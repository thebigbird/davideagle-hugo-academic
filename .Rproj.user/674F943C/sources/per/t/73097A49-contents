Blogdown is a tricky program because it requires remembering all kinds of arcane commands. This post explains how to create and edit new posts. The first step is to run the *blogdown::new_post()* command or click the Addins -> New Post button in RStudio. 

Once this is done and the details are all filled out, the file can be rendered locally with *blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = "timestamp")*, which rebuilds all markdown files whose timestamp have been changed. From here you can serve the site and see what it looks like locally.
