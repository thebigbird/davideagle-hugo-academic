Religious affliation has changed significantly in the United States since 1972. In this example, I plot the change in religious affiliation over time using data from the 1972--2018 (https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data)[General Social Survey].

I have code on (https://github.com/thebigbird/reltrad)[Github] that recodes the GSS into the standard RELTRAD categories that are frequently used by sociologist of religion. This code shows how to use ggplot to create a plot of the trends over time.
    
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = F)
```

```{r,fig.width = 10}
#Create a Figure for GSS attendanc= over time
#Plot the proportions over time
library(srvyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(survey)
library(ggthemes)
#
load("Data/gss.RData") #See my github for the code to make these data
gss = gss %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(as.character(year))) %>%
  mutate(birthyr = year - age) %>%
  mutate(age_cat = cut(birthyr, c(0,1928,1945,1965,1981,1997,2020)))

levels(gss$age_cat) = c("Great","Silent","Boomer","GenX","Millenial","GenZ")

#Creates an explicit missing category
#This sorts
source("~/Box/Projects/Rfunctions/janhove.github.io/RCode/sortLvls.R")
gss$reltrad = sortLvlsByN.fnc(gss$reltrad, ascending = F)
gss$reltrad = sortLvls.fnc(gss$reltrad, c(4,1,2,3,5,6,7))

#Calculate weighted proportions
#Create survey object using svyr
gss_svy <- gss %>% as_survey_design(1, weight = wtssall,
                                    variables = c(year, reltrad, age_cat))

#Now calculate proportions
out = gss_svy %>% 
  group_by(year, reltrad) %>%
  summarize(prop = survey_mean(na.rm=T, proportion = T)) %>%
  drop_na()

#A nice set o' colors
scFill = scale_color_manual(values = 
                              c("#1B9E77", 
                                "#DDC849",
                                "#7570b3", 
                                "#a6761d",

                                "#cc99ff"))

plotout = ggplot(data = out, aes(x=year, y=prop, color = reltrad, group = reltrad)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = prop - 1.96*prop_se, ymax = prop + 1.96*prop_se),

Notice the green line--those who do not claim a religious affiliation--the proportion has increased from 0.05 in 1972 to 0.22 in 2018. Religious nones are now, along with Roman Catholics, the most common religious affiliation in the United States.
