      <title>Why Hauerwas and Willimon are Wrong About Pastoral Care</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;This summer, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.christiancentury.org/article/interview/dangers-providing-pastoral-care&#34;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Christian Century&lt;/em&gt;, Stanley Hauerwas and Will Willimon write about the dangers of providing pastoral care. This piece is deeply flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pull-quote from Willimon proclaims,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better than self-care is to answer the call to care about what Christ cares about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is promoting self-care just an outgrowth of a narcissistic, Western viewpoint? Early in my years at Duke, I often saw Hauerwas jogging around campus. What would Willimon have to say about such a blatant show of narcissism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our research at Clergy Health, we have found pastors are at high risk for developing diabetes. Diabetes is a serious disease that often leads to permanent nerve damage, vision loss and premature death. Isn’t helping pastors to engage in habits that prevent them from developing diabetes simply a good idea? Our food system and way of life has become a diabetes-producing factory. Why shouldn’t we equip pastors with the tools to resist the power of the modern industrial food system? I agree that Christians are called to care about what Christ cares about. The witness of scripture is pretty clear: Christ cares about our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this can go too far. Of course, we can become self-obsessed and self-absorbed. Of course, there is a cult of well being that ignores the basic fact of life that &lt;em&gt;one day we all will die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://faithandleadership.com/jessica-young-brown-ministers-cannot-thrive-if-they-neglect-themselves?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=feature%20story&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ni_newsletter&#34;&gt;Jessica Young Brown&lt;/a&gt; says it well,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work demands that we make time to move toward balance—to evaluate and reevaluate our priorities and boundaries, and to take care of our emotional health. It is not a luxury; it is an act of stewardship that honors what God has given us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willimon continues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, as a bishop, I became troubled that many contemporary pastors aspired only to be obsequious pastoral caregivers and hand-holders—the pastor as the empathetic helping healer who goes for the low-hanging fruit by encouraging people to display and then lick their wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is wrong, plain and simple. It’s a sound-bite that ignores the reality of pastoral ministry. Again, it’s such an un-pastoral thing to say. According to Hauerwas,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pastoral care has become obsessed with the personal wounds of people in advanced industrial societies who have discovered that their lives lack meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a pastor, I remember sitting with a woman in my office who just found out her husband had been engaged in a years-long affair with another woman. What was my proper reponse? &lt;em&gt;Stop licking your wounds.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Stop taking yourself so seriously.&lt;/em&gt; Had I really succumbed to the modern obsession with our personal wounds? What exactly is wrong with pastors being empathetic, helping healers? What is a pastor if not someone who will sit with others in their pain and wait for resurrection on the other side of crucifixion? Isn’t that what it means to “witness to Christ’s cross and resurrection”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long and familiar rant about the emptiness of modern North American psychological culture (as if there is such a thing as a unified North American culture, or that psychology is merely one thing), Hauerwas tells the reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people expect their pastor to help them display and then heal their wounds, the Christian faith is reduced to a technique for gaining control over your life so you can be happy. I hope their pastor would ask, “Why would you come to me for that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a survivor of sexual abuse. Imagine I disclose this to my pastor and ask for help finding a path back to happiness and she says, “Why would you come to me for that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trauma has devastating consequences for individuals and society. Often, the consequence of trauma is survivors have literally lost control of their lives. The church ought to provide a place for survivors to confront their pasts without becoming consumed by them. The resurrection is witness to the fact that the worst of human evil will not ultimately triumph. To so many survivors of trauma happiness is elusive and lies always beyond reach. Is moving people towards happiness such an unworthy goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willimon continues this thread with the following pastoral advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church is the field hospital where those who, having been wounded by their participation in Christ’s mission, are bandaged up so they can be sent right back into the front lines of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is pastoral care really about bandaging our wounds so we can be sent back into battle? I hope not. Many—perhaps most—of our wounds come from the simple fact that we live in a world that is still inhabited by Death. I cannot defeat Death; we cannot defeat Death. It will consume me. Pastoral theology (can Christian theology ever &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be pastoral theology?) ought to acknowledge that humans are powerless in the face of Death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the 17th Century Latin hymn set to the musical genius of Palestrina &lt;a href=&#34;https://hymnary.org/text/the_strife_is_oer_the_battle_done&#34;&gt;proclaims&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strife is o’er, the battle done;&lt;br /&gt;
the victory of life is won;&lt;br /&gt;
the song of triumph has begun.&lt;br /&gt;
Alleluia!&lt;br /&gt;
The powers of death have done their worst,&lt;br /&gt;
but Christ their legions has dispersed.&lt;br /&gt;
Let shouts of holy joy outburst.&lt;br /&gt;
Alleluia!&lt;br /&gt;
The three sad days are quickly sped;&lt;br /&gt;
he rises glorious from the dead.&lt;br /&gt;
All glory to our risen Head.&lt;br /&gt;
Alleluia!&lt;br /&gt;
He closed the yawning gates of hell;&lt;br /&gt;
the bars from heaven’s high portals fell.&lt;br /&gt;
Let hymns of praise his triumph tell.&lt;br /&gt;
Alleluia!&lt;br /&gt;
Lord, by the stripes which wounded thee,&lt;br /&gt;
from death’s dread sting thy servants free,&lt;br /&gt;
that we may live and sing to thee.&lt;br /&gt;
Alleluia!&lt;br /&gt;
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pastor is supposed to be a truth teller, but not as Hauerwas claims, to “help the baptized grow up and survive as Christians.” To me, “grow up and survive” doesn’t sound like the gospel. Rather, as truth tellers, pastors ought to instead boldly proclaim that Death will not have the final word. The pastor-as-truth-teller will proclaim, contrary to so much of our human experience, the truth of the gospel—the strife is over, the battle is done and the Lord God Almighty reigns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reltrad in the U.S., 1972-2018</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Religious affliation has changed significantly in the United States since 1972. In this example, I plot the change in religious affiliation over time using data from the 1972–2018 &lt;a href=&#34;https://gss.norc.org/get-the-data&#34;&gt;General Social Survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have code on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thebigbird/reltrad&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; that recodes the GSS into the standard RELTRAD categories that are frequently used by sociologist of religion. This code shows how to use ggplot to create a plot of the trends over time. @steenslandMeasureAmericanReligion2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few notable trends are evident in this plot. First of all, the proportion of Roman Catholics in the United States has stayed relatively steady over this period. While Latin American immigration has brought a lot of new Catholics to the United States, this has been offset by losses among the non-hispanic Catholic population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there has been a very steep rise in the number of people claiming no religious affiliation. Non-affiliates were a pretty steady 5-8% of the US population from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. The proportion of nones has climbed steeply since then, reaching a high of 25% of the US population, making them the second largest “religious” group in the United States. They could very well surpass Catholics by the time the next wave of GSS data are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher proportion Black Protestant in 1972 is probably due to some sort of artifact in the GSS data. There seems to be a lower proportion of Conservative Protestants that year as well. This blip is also found on other plots of GSS reltrad data, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thesocietypages.org/ccf/2014/07/09/religious-change/fig-2-religious-change/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, Mainline Protestants are in free fall. They are now about 12% of the US population, down about 20 points from their peak in the early 1970s. Conservative Protestants made some gains in the mid-1980s to mid-1990s (probably due to people leaving mainline denominations over cultural issues), but are also declining. They are down about 10 points from their high in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also important is that the “Other” religion category is steadily climbing, and has reached a high of about 5% of the US population. The proportion of the population identifying as Black Protestants remained fairly steady over this period, but recently has begun to decline. This is likely due to more Black Protestants identifying with Conservative Protestant denominations rather that historically Black denominations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating the Reltrad Variable in the General Social Survey Using R</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Haven’t you always wanted an easy to access R script to create the famous reltrad religious categorizaton in the General Social Survey? Well, today is your lucky day.The measure of religious affiliation described in &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;Steensland et al. (&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-steenslandMeasureAmericanReligion2000&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;reltrad&lt;/em&gt;, remains the most popular way to categorize people religiously in the United States. Early development of the measure was done by Corwin Smidt, Bud Kellstedt and James Guth during their annual seminars on measuring religion offered at Calvin College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;reltrad&lt;/em&gt; crowd continues to think their measure is pretty good &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-woodberryMeasureAmericanReligious2012&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;Woodberry et al. 2012&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;reltrad&lt;/em&gt; for African Americans has been developed - this is required reading for those who use &lt;em&gt;reltrad&lt;/em&gt; in their research &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-sheltonBlackReltradMeasuring2017&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;Shelton and Cobb 2017&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;code-conundrums&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code Conundrums&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, the code to create the reltrad variable from the General Social Survey is scattered about. A PDF of Stata code for reltrad is available from Lifeway Research. They have R code, too. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad&#34;&gt;Ryan Burge has code up on Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-better-reltrad-repository&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Better &lt;em&gt;Reltrad&lt;/em&gt; Repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am providing &lt;a href=&#34;https://thebigbird/R_Stata_Reltrad&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;my repository&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I think is the best out there This has a Stata .do file and an R function. Note that I do incorporate the corrections suggested by &lt;span class=&#34;citation&#34;&gt;Stetzer and Burge (&lt;a href=&#34;#ref-stetzerReltradCodingProblems2016&#34; role=&#34;doc-biblioref&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; . Using Kieran Healy’s gssr package, the sample code loads the gss datafile, dumps the oversamples, and then calls the function I’ve written (now mostly in dplyr) to create a &lt;em&gt;reltrad&lt;/em&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thebigbird/R_Stata_Reltrad&#34;&gt;github.com/thebigbird/R_Stata_Reltrad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the code is run, the results can be quickly plotted The following plot looks at how the religious composition of the US has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
