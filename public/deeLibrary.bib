  abstract = {The key intent of this work is to present a comprehensive comparative literature survey of the state-of-art in software agent-based computing technology and its incorporation within the modelling and simulation domain. The original contribution of this survey is two-fold: (1) Present a concise characterization of almost the entire spectrum of agent-based modelling and simulation tools, thereby highlighting the salient features, merits, and shortcomings of such multi-faceted application software; this article covers eighty five agent-based toolkits that may assist the system designers and developers with common tasks, such as constructing agent-based models and portraying the real-time simulation outputs in tabular/graphical formats and visual recordings. (2) Provide a usable reference that aids engineers, researchers, learners and academicians in readily selecting an appropriate agent-based modelling and simulation toolkit for designing and developing their system models and prototypes, cognizant of both their expertise and those requirements of their application domain. In a nutshell, a significant synthesis of Agent Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) resources has been performed in this review that stimulates further investigation into this topic.},

One market with such constraints is that for college coaches, a market subject to both Title IX and EEO regulations. In this article data from over 15,000 coaching and administrative positions are analyzed. The results suggest that as with findings from other studies, a bifurcation of this market may be occurring. Consistent with the intent of Title IX, the number of positions coaching and administering women's athletics has increased. However, contrary to the intent of EEO regulations, the probability of filling a vacant position is not equal across the sexes. These ambiguous developments in the market may reflect ambiguities in governmental equity constraints, as well as supply factors and general trends in the sexual composition of occupations.},

  abstract = {Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, New York's Muslim communities turned to their mosques for help, but were noticeably hesitant to avail themselves of services offered by the broader community. Research has shown that few mental health professionals are familiar with the Arabic language and Islamic values. Moreover, little is known about Islamic counseling and psychotherapy, or the techniques applied by providers in the mosques to help the Islamic community cope with stressful events. This study is intended to examine the role of imams in Muslim mental health promotion and the worshippers' attitudes toward mental health services and resources prior to 9/11 and post-9/11. A cross-sectional survey of 22 imams and 102 worshippers from 22 mosques in New York City was conducted. Our results show that, even though the majority of the 22 imams had no formal training in Western psychotherapy intervention, they nonetheless played a major role in the promotion of mental health in the wake of this national disaster. Imams, we have learned, use a multifaceted model of unstructured psychotherapy intervention based on Islamic directives and teachings. Our study finds that guidance for mental health issues among New York City's Muslim community was sought most often from imams before and after 9/11. Results of the study may help to bridge the gap between Islamic intervention and modern, Westernized psychotherapy paradigms.},

Between February and March 2007, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using four electronic databases. Journal hand searches, citations and bibliographic snowballing of relevant articles were also undertaken. To be included, studies had to be population-based, use well-defined criteria for measuring obesity, present data that allowed calculation of the prevalence of obesity and sample adult participants. Studies retrieved were critically appraised. Meta-analysis was performed using the DerSimonian-Laird random effect model. Twenty-eight studies were included. Thirteen studies were conducted in urban settings, 13 in mixed urban/rural and one in rural setting. Mean body mass index ranged from 20.1 to 27.0 kg2. Prevalence of obesity in West Africa was estimated at 10.0\% (95\% CI, 6.0\textendash 15.0). Women were more likely to be obese than men, odds ratios 3.16 (95\% CI, 2.51\textendash 3.98) and 4.79 (95\% CI, 3.30\textendash 6.95) in urban and rural areas respectively. Urban residents were more likely to be obese than rural residents, odds ratio 2.70 (95\% CI, 1.76\textendash 4.15). Time trend analyses indicated that prevalence of obesity in urban West Africa more than doubled (114\%) over 15 years, accounted for almost entirely in women. Urban residents and women have particularly high risk of overweight/obesity and obesity is rising fast in women. Policymakers, politicians and health promotion experts must urgently help communities control the spread of obesity in West Africa.},

Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality. Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.},

Although studies have found high rates of depression in clergy, the degree of work-related burnout in clergy compared to other occupations is unknown. The widely used Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) measures three aspects of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. We sought studies using comparable versions of the MBI for clergy; for social workers, counselors, and teachers because of those occupations' emotional intensity and labor; and for police and emergency personnel because of the unpredictability and stress-related physiological arousal in those occupations. We found a total of 84 studies and compared the ranges of burnout scores between the studies of clergy, each additional occupation, and MBI published mean norms. Compared to U.S. norms, clergy exhibited moderate rates of burnout. Across the three kinds of burnout, clergy scores were relatively better than those of police and emergency personnel, similar to those of social workers and teachers, and worse than those of counselors. Clergy may benefit from burnout prevention strategies used by counselors. The moderate levels of burnout found for clergy, despite the numerous stressors associated with their occupation, suggest that clergy generally cope well and may be models to study. Overall, there is room for improvement in burnout for all professions, especially police and emergency personnel. It is important to remember the variation within any profession, including clergy, and prevent and address burnout for those in need.},

  abstract = {Background The burden of hypertension is high in Africa, and due to rapid population growth and ageing, the exact burden on the continent is still far from being known. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and awareness rates of hypertension in Africa based on the cut off ``{$\geq$}140/90 mm Hg''. Methods We conducted a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE and Global Health. Search date was set from January 1980 to December 2013. We included population-based studies on hypertension, conducted among people aged {$\geq$}15 years and providing numerical estimates on the prevalence of hypertension in Africa. Overall pooled prevalence of hypertension in mixed, rural and urban settings in Africa were estimated from reported crude prevalence rates. A meta-regression epidemiological modelling, using United Nations population demographics for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2030, was applied to determine the prevalence rates and number of cases of hypertension in Africa separately for these four years. Results Our search returned 7680 publications, 92 of which met the selection criteria. The overall pooled prevalence of hypertension in Africa was 19.7\% in 1990, 27.4\% in 2000 and 30.8\% in 2010, each with a pooled awareness rate (expressed as percentage of hypertensive cases) of 16.9\%, 29.2\% and 33.7\%, respectively. From the modelling, over 54.6 million cases of hypertension were estimated in 1990, 92.3 million cases in 2000, 130.2 million cases in 2010, and a projected increase to 216.8 million cases of hypertension by 2030; each with an age-adjusted prevalence of 19.1\% (13.9, 25.5), 24.3\% (23.3, 31.6), 25.9\% (23.5, 34.0), and 25.3\% (24.3, 39.7), respectively. Conclusion Our findings suggest the prevalence of hypertension is increasing in Africa, and many hypertensive individuals are not aware of their condition. We hope this research will prompt appropriate policy response towards improving the awareness, control and overall management of hypertension in Africa.},

There is a burgeoning literature in this area, but a number of unresolved issues remain. These include the definition of what constitutes a disparity, the relationship of different bases of disadvantage, the ability to attribute cause from association, and the establishment of the mechanisms by which social disadvantage affects biological processes that get into the body, resulting in disease. We examine current definitions and empirical research on health disparities, particularly disparities associated with race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and discuss data structures and analytic strategies that allow causal inference about the health impacts of these and associated factors. We show that although health is consistently worse for individuals with few resources and for blacks as compared with whites, the extent of health disparities varies by outcome, time, and geographic location within the United States. Empirical work also demonstrates the importance of a joint consideration of race/ethnicity and social class. Finally, we discuss potential pathways, including exposure to chronic stress and resulting psychosocial and physiological responses to stress, that serve as mechanisms by which social disadvantage results in health disparities.},

  abstract = {Limited research has been conducted to explore the factors that support or obstruct collaboration between traditional healers and public sector mental health services. The first aim of this study was to explore the reasons underpinning the widespread appeal of traditional/faith healers in Ghana. This formed a backdrop for the second objective, to identify what barriers or enabling factors may exist for forming bi-sectoral partnerships. Eighty-one semi-structured interviews and seven focus group discussions were conducted with 120 key stakeholders drawn from five of the ten regions in Ghana. The results were analysed through a framework approach. Respondents indicated many reasons for the appeal of traditional and faith healers, including cultural perceptions of mental disorders, the psychosocial support afforded by such healers, as well as their availability, accessibility and affordability. A number of barriers hindering collaboration, including human rights and safety concerns, scepticism around the effectiveness of `conventional' treatments, and traditional healer solidarity were identified. Mutual respect and bi-directional conversations surfaced as the key ingredients for successful partnerships. Collaboration is not as easy as commonly assumed, given paradigmatic disjunctures and widespread scepticism between different treatment modalities. Promoting greater understanding, rather than maintaining indifferent distances may lead to more successful co-operation in future.},

The aim was to examine whether work engagement acts as a mediator between job resources (i.e. supervisory relations, interpersonal relations and task resources) and personal resources (self-esteem) on the one hand and future work ability (i.e. a worker's functional ability to do their job) on the other. The second aim was to investigate the mediating role of engagement between past work ability and future work ability. Structural equation modelling was used to test the mediation hypotheses among Finnish firefighters (N = 403). As hypothesized, engagement at T2 fully mediated the impact of job and personal resources at T1 on work ability at T2. In addition, the effect of work ability at T1 on work ability at T2 was partially mediated by engagement at T2. These results indicate that job and personal resources may have long-term effects on engagement, and consequently on work ability, thus expanding on the propositions of the JD-R model. The results show a dual role of work ability, as a health-related resource that may foster engagement and an outcome driven by the motivational process proposed by the JD-R model.},

The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), involving public interview and mental arithmetic performance, is among the most popular methods of inducing acute stress in experimental settings, and reliably increases hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. However, although much research has focused on HPA axis activity, the TSST also affects the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system, the immune system, cardiovascular outputs, gastric function and cognition. We critically assess the utility of different biological and psychological markers, with guidance for future research, and discuss factors which can moderate TSST effects. We outline the effects of the TSST in stress-related disorders, and if these responses can be abrogated by pharmacological and psychological treatments. Modified TSST protocols are discussed, and the TSST is compared to alternative methods of inducing acute stress. Our analysis suggests that multiple readouts are necessary to derive maximum information; this strategy will enhance our understanding of the psychobiology of stress and provide the means to assess novel therapeutic agents.},

  abstract = {Researchers interested in the neurobiology of the acute stress response in humans require a valid and reliable acute stressor that can be used under experimental conditions. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) provides such a testing platform. It induces stress by requiring participants to make an interview-style presentation, followed by a surprise mental arithmetic test, in front of an interview panel who do not provide feedback or encouragement. In this review, we outline the methodology of the TSST, and discuss key findings under conditions of health and stress-related disorder. The TSST has unveiled differences in males and females, as well as different age groups, in their neurobiological response to acute stress. The TSST has also deepened our understanding of how genotype may moderate the cognitive neurobiology of acute stress, and exciting new inroads have been made in understanding epigenetic contributions to the biological regulation of the acute stress response using the TSST. A number of innovative adaptations have been developed which allow for the TSST to be used in group settings, with children, in combination with brain imaging, and with virtual committees. Future applications may incorporate the emerging links between the gut microbiome and the stress response. Future research should also maximise use of behavioural data generated by the TSST. Alternative acute stress paradigms may have utility over the TSST in certain situations, such as those that require repeat testing. Nonetheless, we expect that the TSST remains the gold standard for examining the cognitive neurobiology of acute stress in humans.,                                        \textbullet{}               The TSST is the human experimental gold standard for evaluating the neurobiology of acute stress.                                         \textbullet{}               The HPA axis response to the TSST is higher in males and lower in older adults.                                         \textbullet{}               Genotype and epigenetic factors moderate the neurobiological response to the TSST.                                         \textbullet{}               Multiple adaptations of the TSST are available for different testing contexts.},

In this study, participants in the stress-inducing condition (N = 52, 44\%) were asked to answer general knowledge and mathematical questions which people often get wrong, and did so under time pressure as well as receiving feedback. In contrast, participants in the control condition (N = 66, 56\%) did not have time pressure or receive feedback. The stress manipulation was found to be effective, as the reported state anxiety and visual analog scale on stress scores were higher for the stress group than for the non-stress group (both findings, p {$<$} 0.001). Consistent findings were found when accounting for trait anxiety as a moderator, with the exception of the state anxiety levels in high trait anxiety group. This stressing method combines the established stress conditions of uncontrollability (such as time pressures) and social evaluative threats (such as negative feedback). In addition, the method contains specific measures (such as a commitment statement and attention check questions) to enhance the internal validity by preventing and detecting cheating or random responses. This method can be deployed through any commonly available online software. It offers a simple and cost-effective way to collect data online \textendash{} which fits the increasing need to carry out research in virtual and online environments.},

The objective of this article is to examine the relationship between job satisfaction, financial stress and adequate retirement savings of nearretirement pastors in Southern Africa. The method of data collection (quantitative) was executed by distributing structured questionnaires among South African Dutch Reformed pastors who are retiring within the next 5 years. The respondents indicated high levels of job satisfaction and low levels of stress, even though high percentages indicated that they are either uncertain or did not save enough money for retirement. It was found that there is a relationship between job satisfaction, financial stress and adequate retirement savings and that if clergy have adequate retirement savings, this will have a positive relationship with job satisfaction and financial stress. Clergy find themselves in a unique position towards their calling and their finances and therefore need a more structured approach to their personal financial management. Because their relationship with God and money is so distinctive, so should be the guidance they receive with regards to it.},

Limited access to healthy food options may contribute to unhealthy diets5,6. Studying diets is challenging, typically restricted to small sample sizes, single locations, and non-uniform design across studies, and has led to mixed results on the impact of the food environment7\textendash 23. Here we leverage smartphones to track diet health, operationalized through the self-reported consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, fast food and soda, as well as body-mass index status in a country-wide observational study of 1,164,926 U.S. participants (MyFitnessPal app users) and 2.3 billion food entries to study the independent contributions of fast food and grocery store access, income and education to diet health outcomes. This study constitutes the largest nationwide study examining the relationship between the food environment and diet to date. We find that higher access to grocery stores, lower access to fast food, higher income and college education are independently associated with higher consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, lower consumption of fast food and soda, and lower likelihood of being affected by overweight and obesity. However, these associations vary significantly across zip codes with predominantly Black, Hispanic or white populations. For instance, high grocery store access has a significantly larger association with higher fruit and vegetable consumption in zip codes with predominantly Hispanic populations (7.4\% difference) and Black populations (10.2\% difference) in contrast to zip codes with predominantly white populations (1.7\% difference). Policy targeted at improving food access, income and education may increase healthy eating, but intervention allocation may need to be optimized for specific subpopulations and locations.},

  abstract = {This article examines three hypotheses about the relation between age and the stability of sociopolitical attitudes. The hypotheses are (1) the impressionable-year hypothesis, which states that the youngest adults have the least stable attitudes; (2) the aging-stability hypothesis, that attitude stability increases with age; and (3) the hypothesis that symbolic attitudes are more likely to show distinctive life-cycle patterns of attitude stability than less symbolic ones. The hypotheses are tested using nationally representative panel data from the National Election Study (NES). When results are aggregated over 50 different measures of attitudes, they reveal that in general the youngest adults have the lowest levels of attitude stability, although the difference is not significant. Beyond this, the aggregated data show very few systematic age-related differences, and very few life-span differences in attitude stability are related to the nature of the attitude object; that is, symbolic attitudes do not seem to differ systematically from nonsymbolic attitudes in the relationship of age to stability. However, the examination of intracohort patterns of change in stability, using a comparison of stabilities in political party identification across the 1956-1958-1960 and the 1972-1974-1976 NES panel studies, reveals systematic differences that provide clear support for the impressionable-years and aging-stability hypotheses. The decomposition of the stabilities in this measure into components representing "direction" and "intensity" of political partisanship suggests that the intensity component of partisan attitudes declines in stability in old age, whereas the stability of the direction of party loyalties either increases or persists with age. The prevailing model of political socialization-that persons become more "persistent" with age-is reevaluated on the basis of these findings.},

As for the conditions under which movements matter, scholars have been revising their initial hypotheses that the strategies, organizational forms, and political contexts that aid mobilization also aid in gaining and exerting political influence. Scholars are exploring alternative arguments about the productivity of different actions and characteristics of movements and movement organizations in the varied political contexts and institutional settings they face. Researchers are also employing more innovative research designs to appraise these more complex arguments. Scholarship will advance best if scholars continue to think through the interactions between strategies, organizations, and contexts; address movement influences on processes in institutional politics beyond the agenda-setting stage; situate case studies in comparative and historical perspective; and make more comparisons across movements and issues.},

This article uses in-depth qualitative data from a religiously diverse U.S. sample to argue that this either/or distinction not only fails to capture the empirical reality of American religion, it does no justice to the complexity of spirituality. An inductive discursive analysis reveals four primary cultural ``packages,'' or ways in which people construct the meaning of spirituality in conversation: a Theistic Package tying spirituality to personal deities, an Extra-Theistic Package locating spirituality in various naturalistic forms of transcendence, an Ethical Spirituality focusing on everyday compassion, and a contested Belief and Belonging Spirituality tied to cultural notions of religiosity. Spirituality, then, is neither a diffuse individualized phenomenon nor a single cultural alternative to ``religion.'' Analysis of the contested evaluations of Belief and Belonging Spirituality allows a window on the ``moral boundary work'' being done through identifying as ``spiritual but not religious.'' The empirical boundary between spirituality and religion is far more orous than is the moral and political one.},

We find that ROIE mostly concentrate on race-related outcomes and may vary by respondent's race for some outcomes. But we find no statistically significant evidence that ROIE vary by the interview mode (i.e., in person vs. by phone).

  abstract = {Objectives: First, to learn how veteran (2 years or more) child protective service (CPS) investigations workers cope with job stress; and secondly, to examine the relationship between coping strategies and levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and sense of reduced personal accomplishment (burnout syndrome). Method: Cross-sectional, self-report methodology was used to measure coping strategies and the burnout syndrome. The voluntary subjects were 151 front-line CPS workers with at least 2 years experience in a southeastern Department of Social Services. They attended one of nine stress management workshops provided in various locations around the state. Quantitative analyses were run on the data. Results: These workers perceived themselves to use Engaged (active) coping strategies more than Disengaged (avoidant) strategies. Sixty-two percent of participants scored in the high range on Emotional Exhaustion, the aspect some researchers consider to be the heart of Burnout. Those who used Engaged coping were less likely to feel depersonalized and more likely to feel a sense of personal accomplishment. Those who used Disengaged coping were more likely to feel emotionally exhausted, depersonalized, and to have a sense of reduced personal accomplishment. Conclusion: Neither the use of active nor avoidant coping strategies saved these workers from Emotional Exhaustion. The problem-focused strategies they are taught and use most do not help deal with the emotional content and context of their work, suggesting the use of emotion-focused coping to prevent and remediate burnout. \textcopyright{} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Bargaining over charitable giving, rather than letting one spouse take charge, is estimated to reduce giving by at least 6 percent. When the woman is the decisionmaker, she will still make a significantly different allocation of those charity dollars, preferring to give to more charities but to give less to each.

However, studies on the efficacy of religious coping for people dealing with stressful situations have yielded mixed results. No published studies to date have attempted to quantitatively synthesize the research on religious coping and psychological adjustment to stress. The purpose of the current study was to synthesize the research on situation-specific religious coping methods and quantitatively determine their efficacy for people dealing with stressful situations. A meta-analysis of 49 relevant studies with a total of 105 effect sizes was conducted in order to quantitatively examine the relationship between religious coping and psychological adjustment to stress. Four types of relationships were investigated: positive religious coping with positive psychological adjustment, positive religious coping with negative psychological adjustment, negative religious coping with positive psychological adjustment, and negative religious coping with negative psychological adjustment. The results of the study generally supported the hypotheses that positive and negative forms of religious coping are related to positive and negative psychological adjustment to stress, respectively. Implications of the findings and their limitations are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol.},

We provide empirical illustrations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tests. The finite sample size and power performance of the tests are also investigated through a Monte Carlo study.

Despite research demonstrating the automatic perception of race (and thus the seeming improbability of actual color blindness), the color-blind approach to race has become increasingly prevalent in a variety of important domains, from education and business to law and societal discourse. An emerging research literature has revealed the many ways in which color blindness shapes individual, group, and institutional efforts to handle issues related to diversity. We offer an integrative assessment of this work, highlighting recent psychological investigations that have explored the emergence, practice, and implications of color blindness. We conclude by discussing alternative strategies for managing diversity and underscoring the importance of an approach that simultaneously accommodates the concerns of Whites and minorities.},

We find that on average it is the more fortunate members of rural society who belong in CBOs. In Senegal, the dominant criterion is land ownership. In Burkina Faso it is age and family ties with village authorities. Ethnicity plays a role as well: CBO membership is less likely for ethnic groups that traditionally emphasize livestock raising. Next we look for evidence of assortative matching along multiple dimensions, using an original methodology based on dyadic regressions. We find robust evidence of positive assorting by physical and ethnic proximity as well as by wealth and household size. Along certain dimensions, donor-sponsored CBOs are less elitist and more inclusive. But the reverse is true for other dimensions, particularly in Burkina Faso.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Although screening for unipolar depression is controversial, it is potentially an efficient way to find undetected cases and improve diagnostic acumen. Using a reference standard, we aimed to validate the 2- and 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) in primary care settings. The PHQ-2 comprises the first 2 questions of the PHQ-9. METHODS Consecutive adult patients attending Auckland family practices completed the PHQ-9, after which they completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) depression reference standard. Sensitivities and specificities for PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 were analyzed. RESULTS There were 2,642 patients who completed both the PHQ-9 and the CIDI. Sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-2 for diagnosing major depression were 86\% and 78\%, respectively, with a score of 2 or higher and 61\% and 92\% with a score 3 or higher; for the PHQ-9, they were 74\% and 91\%, respectively, with a score of 10 or higher. For the PHQ-2 a score of 2 or higher detected more cases of depression than a score of 3 or higher. For the PHQ-9 a score of 10 or higher detected more cases of major depression than the PHQ determination of major depression originally described by Spitzer et al in 1999. CONCLUSIONS We report the largest validation study of the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, compared with a reference standard interview, undertaken in an exclusively primary care population. The PHQ-2 score or 2 or higher had good sensitivity but poor specificity in detecting major depression. Using a PHQ-2 threshold score of 2 or higher rather than 3 or higher resulted in more depressed patients being correctly identified. A PHQ-9 score of 10 or higher appears to detect more depressed patients than the originally described PHQ-9 scoring for major depression.},

  abstract = {What effect do religion and culture have on the dueling forces of democracy and authoritarianism? Motivated by a series of single-country case studies, a recent slew of quantitative work implementing cross-country regressions has consistently found a strong negative effect of Islam on political freedoms and other measures of democracy, even when controlling for other factors. In this paper we revisit the relationship between Islam and democracy. First, we offer a new instrumental variables strategy stemming from historical demographic movements that allows us to isolate the effect of Islam on political regime type. Second, we assemble new sources of historical data to construct a panel dataset, enabling us to employ fixed effects models that control for country-specific correlates of both Islam and authoritarianism. Implementing these two strategies largely eliminates the estimated negative effect of Islam on democracy. In fact, in most of our specifications the point estimates of Islam's effect on democracy are actually large and positive, indicating that correcting for omitted variables, Islam's effect is to actually increase democracy. However, our estimates are not statistically significant.},

This Handbook provides an unparalleled, critical guide to its principles and practice.  The volume is organized into three sections. The first systematically locates ethnography firmly in its relevant historical and intellectual contexts. The roots of ethnography are pinpointed and the pattern of its development is demonstrated.  The second section examines the contribution of ethnography to major fields of substantive research. The impact and strengths and weaknesses of ethnographic method are dealt with authoritatively and accessibly.  The third section moves on to examine key debates and issues in ethnography, from the conduct of research through to contemporary arguments.  The result is a landmark work in the field, which draws on the expertise of an internationally renowned group of interdisicplinary scholars. The Handbook of Ethnography provides readers with a one-stop critical guide to the past, present and future of ethnography. It will quickly establish itself as the ethnographer's bible.},

We sought to systematically assess the effect of collaborative care on depression and glycaemia in adults with comorbid depression and diabetes to inform guidelines and practice. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Health Source Nursing, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and reference lists of retrieved articles published before August 2013. Inclusion criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on collaborative care (ie, coordinated multidisciplinary model of care) for depression that reported the effects on depression and glycaemic outcomes in adults with comorbid clinically relevant depression and diabetes were eligible. Data extraction and analysis: Data on the mean difference in depression and glycaemic outcomes were extracted and pooled using random effects meta-analysis. Results: Seven RCTs included for review reported effects on depression outcomes in 1895 participants, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level in 1556 participants. Collaborative care significantly improved the depression score (standardised mean difference was -0.32 (95\% CI -0.53 to -0.11); I2=79\%) and HbA1c level (weighted mean difference was -0.33\% (95\% CI -0.66\% to -0.00\%); I2=72.9\%) compared with control conditions. Depression remission did not predict better glycaemic control across studies. Conclusions: Limited evidence from short-to-medium term RCTs predominantly conducted in the USA suggests that collaborative care for depression significantly improves both depression and glycaemia outcomes, independently, in people with comorbid depression and diabetes.},

  abstract = {Social scientists often explain religious effects in terms of religious group affiliations. Typically, researchers identify religious groups by denomination or some broader popular categorization, such as ``fundamentalist'' or ``evangelical.'' To capture religious differences more effectively, Steensland et al. (2000) propose an intricate classification of American denominations that takes into account the theology and historical development of various American religious traditions to predict individual attitudes and behaviors. We believe that equal care and attention should be devoted to the development of key measures of belief that may cross denominational lines. In this article, we propose one such measure: personal conceptions or images of God. Our simple measure of conceptions of God predicts church attendance rates, belief in biblical literalism, political party identification, attitudes toward abortion, and attitudes about sexual morality. In addition, this indicator provides a means to understand variation within religious traditions. Views of God's character provide a straightforward way to describe religious differences and an efficient means to demonstrate how religion affects the world. Bader and Froese: Images of God 3 The significance of religion is ... a reflection of what God as the object of religion does to our worldview. Georg Simmel 1997 (1904) When we say that someone is very religious, what do we mean? To judge by much of the research literature, we mean that the person belongs to a particular religious group (e.g., Baptist rather than Unitarian) or to a particular type of religious group (e.g., ``fundamentalist'' or ``evangelical,'' as opposed to ``liberal'' or ``moderate''). Even so, when we ask what these markers of religiousness represent, the answer almost always involves some aspect of belief. That is, most fundamentalists and evangelicals believe things that most moderates and liberals do not. But if that is the actual basis of individual religious differences, why don't we use it? Certainly, denominational affiliation provides a measure that can be used to investigate the impact of group membership on the individual, but it fails to demonstrate how religious faith affects the individual. If we want to investigate the influence of religion on attitudes and behaviors, it behooves us to determine whether there exists a direct connection between religious belief and attitudes and behavior. In this article, we demonstrate that measures of individual conceptions of God reduce the misclassifications that arise when the ``fundamentalist'' minority of Episcopalians is scored as liberal and the liberals among the Southern Baptists are scored as fundamentalists in current denominational typologies. We begin with a review of the most persuasive and admired denominational classification scheme.},

  abstract = {Background: High job demands and low job resources may cause job strain and eventually result in burnout. However, previous research has generally ignored the roles of time and self-regulation. Objectives: This theoretical article synthesizes the literature to propose a multilevel model that delineates how acute job strain translates into enduring and severe job burnout. Methods: We integrate self-regulation perspectives in job demands-resources (JD-R) theory to propose that short-term job strain and eventually enduring burnout is the result of consistently high job demands and low job resources \textendash{} combined with failed self-regulation. Results: The model shows that when employees are confronted with increased job strain, they are more likely to use maladaptive self-regulation strategies, such as coping inflexibility and self-undermining. In addition, when job strain increases, employees are less likely to use adaptive self-regulation strategies, such as job stress recovery and job crafting. It follows that when the job becomes more stressful, stable resources become more important. Organizational resources such as human resource practices and healthy leadership may help employees to regulate their short-term fatigue and avoid enduring burnout. Furthermore, key personal resources like emotional intelligence and proactive personality may help employees to recognize and regulate their fatigue in an effective way. Conclusion: The proposed model of burnout expands JD-R theory and offers important practical implications for the prevention and reduction of burnout.},

On the basis of social exchange and equity theory, it is hypothesized and found that demanding patient contacts produce a lack of reciprocity in the GP-patient relationship, which, in turn, depletes GPs' emotional resources and initiates the burnout syndrome. More specifically, structural equation analyses confirmed that - both at T1 and T2 - lack of reciprocity mediates the impact of patient demands on emotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion, in turn, evokes negative attitudes toward patients, and toward oneself in relation to the job. Finally, T1 depersonalization predicted the intensity and frequency of T2 patient demands. This major finding suggests that GPs who attempt to gain emotional distance from their patients as a way of coping with their exhaustion, evoke demanding and threatening patient behaviors themselves.},

The methodology also allows us to estimate that less than 40 percent of poverty spells begin because of a drop in the heads' earnings, while 60 percent of the spells end when the heads' earnings increase. Thus, researchers must focus on household formation decisions and on the behavior of secondary family members.},

Methods An extensive multi-level search for publicly available ethics regulatory guidance was conducted for each SSA country. A second review documented active trials listed in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform as of January 2015 in which HBS collection was specified in the protocol. Findings were combined to determine the extent to which countries that are study sites for HBS-related research are supported by regulatory guidance language on the collection, use, ownership and storage of biospecimens. Results Of the 49 SSA countries, 29 had some form of national ethics guidance, yet only 17 provided language relating to HBS-related research, with specific guidance on consent (14), ownership (6), reuse (10), storage (9), and export/import/transfer (13). Ten countries accounted for 84~\% of the active clinical trials involving the collection of HBS in SSA. All except one of these countries were found to have some national guidance in the form of regulations, codes of ethics, and/or standard operating procedures; however, only seven of the ten offered any language specific to HBS. Conclusions Despite the fact that the bulk of registered clinical trials in SSA involving HBS, as well as existing and proposed sites for biorepositories under the H3Africa Initiative, are currently situated in countries with the most complete ethics and regulatory guidance, variability in the regulations themselves may create challenges for planned and future pan-African collaborations and may require legislative action at the national level to revise. Countries in SSA that still lack regulatory guidance on HBS will require extensive health system strengthening in ethics governance before they can be full participants in the modern research enterprise.},

Demographic data included age, income, marital status, race/ethnicity, and education. Behavioral data included physical activity (metabolic equivalent hours per week for vigorous or moderate muscle strengthening, walking/biking, and house/ yard work), and poor diet (refined grains, red meat, added sugars, solid fats, and high-fat dairy). Structural-equation modeling was performed to examine the interrelationships among these variables with family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, BMI, large waist (waist circumference: women, \$35 inches; men, \$40 inches), triglycerides \$200 mg/dL, and total and HDL (\$60 mg/dL) cholesterol. RESULTSdAfter dropping BMI and total cholesterol, our best-fit model included three single factors: socioeconomic position (SEP), physical activity, and poor diet. Large waist had the strongest direct effect on prediabetes (0.279), followed by male sex (0.270), SEP (20.157), high blood pressure (0.122), family history of diabetes (0.070), and age (0.033). Physical activity had direct effects on HDL (0.137), triglycerides (20.136), high blood pressure (20.132), and large waist (20.067); poor diet had direct effects on large waist (0.146) and triglycerides (0.148). CONCLUSIONSdOur results confirmed that, while including factors known to be associated with high risk of developing prediabetes, large waist circumference had the strongest direct effect. The direct effect of SEP on prediabetes suggests mediation by some unmeasured factor(s).},

  abstract = {Religious leaders often experience burnout, which is characterized by emotional exhaustion and/or low satisfaction. Clergy with high emotional exhaustion feel drained and discouraged. Clergy with high satisfaction report that the ministry gives purpose and meaning to their lives. Hierarchichal regression was used to examine if current clergy's desire to please others, guilt or shame orientation, ability to be self-compassionate, and ability to differentiate self from role uniquely predicted variation in burnout. Although all personality dimensions explained significant variation in emotional satisfaction when examined individually, due to inter-correlations among predictors only self-compassion was significant in the full model. Higher self-compassion was also related to increased satisfaction in ministry. Increasing self-compassion may prevent clergy burnout.},

In this analysis, Black clergy dialogue during focus groups about inclusivity and church leadership by gays and lesbians. Informed by Cultural Theory, of equal interest is whether discourses are influenced by Black Church cultural tools, as well as cultural dynamics, from the broader Black community. As anticipated, findings suggest the tendency for clergy to promote welcoming church spaces, but to be reticent about affirming homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. Furthermore, although clergy are generally supportive of involvement by closeted gays and lesbians as lay leaders, most do not support their involvement in the clergy, particularly as pastors. However, views vary based on denomination and gender, and are informed by Black Church cultural components such as scripture and the call-and-response tradition.},

The effects of reward structures and sorting processes on workers, organizational performance, and interorganizational relations are also considered briefly. Since many hypotheses about labor markets concern links between organizations and socioeconomic achievement, there is a need for comparative organizational research to complement analyses at the individual and aggregate levels. Moreover, the interdependence of career outcomes within and among enterprises is widely recognized but requires explicit study. Future research will benefit immeasurably from the development and testing of hypotheses about how organizations and environments influence labor market processes.},

Results indicated that one dimension of personality, Conscientiousness, showed consistent relations with all job performance criteria for all occupational groups. For the remaining personality dimensions, the estimated true score correlations varied by occupational group and criterion type. Extraversion was a valid predictor for two occupations involving social interaction, managers and sales (across criterion types). Also, both Openness to Experience and Extraversion were valid predictors of the training proficiency criterion (across occupations). Other personality dimensions were also found to be valid predictors for some occupations and some criterion types, but the magnitude of the estimated true score correlations was small ({$\rho$} {$<$} .10). Overall, the results illustrate the benefits of using the 5-factor model of personality to accumulate and communicate empirical findings. The findings have numerous implications for research and practice in personnel psychology, especially in the subfields of personnel selection, training and development, and performance appraisal.},

  abstract = {Background: Cross-sectional studies with binary outcomes analyzed by logistic regression are frequent in the epidemiological literature. However, the odds ratio can importantly overestimate the prevalence ratio, the measure of choice in these studies. Also, controlling for confounding is not equivalent for the two measures. In this paper we explore alternatives for modeling data of such studies with techniques that directly estimate the prevalence ratio. Methods: We compared Cox regression with constant time at risk, Poisson regression and log-binomial regression against the standard Mantel-Haenszel estimators. Models with robust variance estimators in Cox and Poisson regressions and variance corrected by the scale parameter in Poisson regression were also evaluated. Results: Three outcomes, from a cross-sectional study carried out in Pelotas, Brazil, with different levels of prevalence were explored: weight-for-age deficit (4\%), asthma (31\%) and mother in a paid job (52\%). Unadjusted Cox/Poisson regression and Poisson regression with scale parameter adjusted by deviance performed worst in terms of interval estimates. Poisson regression with scale parameter adjusted by {$\chi$}2 showed variable performance depending on the outcome prevalence. Cox/Poisson regression with robust variance, and log-binomial regression performed equally well when the model was correctly specified. Conclusions: Cox or Poisson regression with robust variance and log-binomial regression provide correct estimates and are a better alternative for the analysis of cross-sectional studies with binary outcomes than logistic regression, since the prevalence ratio is more interpretable and easier to communicate to non-specialists than the odds ratio. However, precautions are needed to avoid estimation problems in specific situations.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite the signing of international peace agreements, a deadly war continues in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and sexual violence is a prominent modus operandi of many military groups operating in the region. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of women who presented to Panzi Hospital in 2006 requesting post-sexual violence care. Data was extracted and analyzed to describe the patterns of sexual violence. Results: A total of 1,021 medical records were reviewed. A majority of attacks occurred in individual homes (56.5\%), with the fields (18.4\%) and the forest (14.3\%) also being frequent locations of attack. In total, 58.9\% of all attacks occurred at night. Of the four primary types of sexual violence, gang rape predominated (59.3\%) and rape Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) was also common (21.5\%). Sexual slavery was described by 4.9\% of the survivors and a combination of gang rape and sexual slavery was described by 11.7\%. The mean number of assailants per attack was 2.5 with a range of one to {$>$} 15. There were several demographic predictors for sexual slavery. Controlling for age, education level and occupation, a marital status of "single" increased the risk of sexual slavery (OR = 2.97, 95\% CI = 1.12-7.85). Similarly, after controlling for other variables, age was a significant predictor of sexual slavery with older women being at a slightly reduced risk (OR = 0.96, 95\% CI = 0.92-0.99). Women who experienced sexual slavery were 37 times more likely to have a resultant pregnancy in comparison to those who reported other types of sexual violence (OR =37.50, 95\% CI = 14.57 -99.33). Conclusions: Among sexual violence survivors presenting to Panzi Hospital in 2006, the majority of attacks occurred in women's own homes, often at night. This represents a pattern of violence that differs from other conflict settings and has important implications regarding protection strategies. Sexual violence in South Kivu was also marked with a predominance of gang rape, thus increasing the risk of serious injury as well as the likelihood of an individual woman contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Sexual slavery was noted to be more common among young, single women and was found to have a high rate of resultant pregnancy.},

Methods: In a cross-sectional study, the GAD-7, the PHQ-9 (depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire) and the WHO-DAS II (12-item World Health Organization Disability Scale) were administered to n {$\frac{1}{4}$}647 Ivorian and n {$\frac{1}{4}$}395 Ghanaian antepartum women with low-risk pregnancies (third trimester; gestational age range: 28\textendash 40 weeks) in 2010\textendash 2011. Statistical analyses combined classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Results: Cronbach's {$\alpha$} was close to acceptable ({$\alpha$} {$\frac{1}{4}$}.69 in C\^ote d'Ivoire; {$\alpha$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} .67 in Ghana). Construct validity was demonstrated by correlations between the GAD-7 and both the PHQ-9 and the WHO-DAS II. Results regarding factorial validity were ambiguous: confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses indicated that the data fit the unidimensionality assumption; however, the explained variance was low. IRT methods suggested excellent item infit and outfit measures. Yet, residual principal component analyses showed a lack of unidimensionality. Rasch analyses revealed that the response options were not used as intended. Item-person-fit was not optimal since the items did not discriminate well on the range of the latent construct where most of the women drawn from the general population were located. Limitations: Both samples were somewhat homogenous regarding gestational age and urban residence; test\textendash retest reliability was not investigated. Conclusion: The GAD-7 met the requirements of CTT. However, applying the stricter criteria of IRT suggested areas for potential improvements. Cross-cultural adaption and a dichotomized response format might ameliorate the GAD-7 for the use in sub-Saharan countries.},

The empirical analysis is conducted using a semilog hedonic house price equation and a spherical autocorrelation function with data for over 5000 transactions of homes sold between 1991:4 and 1993:1. Properties are geocoded and assigned to separate housing submarkets within metropolitan Dallas. Hedonic and spherical autocorrelation parameters are estimated separately for each submarket using estimated generalized least squares (EGLS). We \textregistered nd strong evidence of spatial autocorrelation in transaction prices within submarkets. Results for spatially autocorrelated residuals are mixed. In four of eight submarkets, there is evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the hedonic residuals for single-family properties located within a 1200 meter radius. In two submarkets, the hedonic residuals are spatially autocorrelated throughout the submarket, while the hedonic residuals are spatially uncorrelated in the remaining two submarkets. Finally, we compare OLS and kriged EGLS predicted values for properties sold during 1993:1. Kriged EGLS predictions are more accurate than OLS in six of eight submarkets, while OLS has smaller prediction errors in submarkets where the residuals are spatially uncorrelated and the estimated semivariogram has a large variance.},

This study evaluated the validity of adults' reports of childhood paternal social class. Methods: Data are drawn from the Aberdeen children of the 1950s study, a cohort of 12 150 people born in Aberdeen (Scotland) who took part in a school based survey in 1962. In this survey, two indices of early life socioeconomic position were collected: occupational social class at birth (abstracted from maternity records) and occupational social class in childhood (reported during the 1962 survey by the study participants). Between 2000 and 2003, a questionnaire was mailed to traced middle aged cohort members in which inquiries were made about their fathers' occupation when they were aged 12 years. The level of agreement between these reports and prospectively collected data on occupational social class was assessed. Results: In total, 7183 (63.7\%) persons responded to the mid-life questionnaire. Agreement was moderate between social class of father recalled in adulthood and that measured in early life (k statistics were 0.47 for social class measured at birth, and 0.56 for social class reported by the child). The relation of occupational social class to birth weight and childhood intelligence was in the expected directions, although weaker for adults' reports in comparison with prospectively gathered data. Conclusions: In studies of adult disease aetiology, associations between childhood social class based on adult recall of parental occupation and health outcomes are likely to underestimate real effects.},

Second, the obesity gradient widens over the lifecycle, consistent with research on other health outcomes. Third, a substantial portion of the ``effect'' of early life conditions operates through race/ethnicity and the translation of advantaged family backgrounds during childhood into higher levels of subsequent education.

  abstract = {We praise certain artworks for their profundity and subtlety, for the insights they provide or for how they make us see the world anew and we think these features are artistically relevant. We criticize other works for their shallowness, superficiality or sentimentality and think them thus artistically flawed. These are artistic evaluations that seem also to be, or to depend on, cognitive evaluations. Aesthetic cognitivism takes such features of our evaluations of art-works seriously. It is best thought of as a conjunction of an epistemic and an aesthetic claim: 1 (1) Epistemic claim: Artworks have cognitive functions. (2) Aesthetic claim: Cognitive functions of artworks partly determine their artistic value. Aesthetic non-cognitivism is the denial of either or both of the epistemic and aesthetic claims. This kind of aesthetic cognitivism must be distinguished from cognitivism regarding aesthetic judgments; a position corresponding to the kind of cognitivism discussed in meta-ethics and usually defined by the thesis that aesthetic judgments can be true or false. It is important not to construe the epistemic and the aesthetic thesis as too strong. The epistemic thesis (1) does not claim that all artworks have cognitive functions. I presume that works of all of the arts but not all works of an art have cognitive functions; hence, that (1) holds true not only for the representational arts, such as literature, film and figurative painting , but also for abstract painting, pure music, non-narrative dance, and even for architecture. However, I will not argue for that presumption here, and most of my examples will be taken from the representational arts. The aesthetic thesis (2) does not claim that all cognitive functions of artworks increase their aesthetic value. We can use artworks as sources of information in a manner that has nothing to do with them being artworks. Often, an artwork will teach us something about its artist, and ancient artworks reveal much about the cultures that produced them. But such a function of artworks as biographical or historical evidence does not reveal that they are therefore better works of art. Hence, only those cognitive functions an artwork has as an artwork, thus belonging to its proper functions, are artistically relevant. Furthermore, claim (1) leaves room for other functions, such as practical, decorative, political and economic ones, and can acknowledge that the importance of cognitive functions differs across the arts (and within an art for different works). While they may be central to the repre-sentational arts, they might be less eminent in abstract painting, pure music, non-narrative dance and architecture. Claim (2) leaves room for a plurality of artistic values, of which cog-nitive ones are just one type. Cognitive functions of artworks only partly determine their artistic value. In this paper, my first aim is to defend the epistemic thesis of aesthetic cognitivism. Since it seems undeniable that artworks have cognitive functions, yet less clear whether they have Christian Wolff (ed.): Bilder sehen. Perspektiven der Bildwissenschaft.

  abstract = {Context: Tens of thousands of the estimated 250 000 child soldiers worldwide are abused or have been abused during the last decade in Africa's Great Lakes Region. In the process of rebuilding the war-torn societies, it is important to understand how psychological trauma may shape the former child soldiers' ability to reconcile. Objective: To investigate the association of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and openness to reconciliation and feelings of revenge in former Ugandan and Congolese child soldiers. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional field study of 169 former child soldiers (aged 11-18 years) in rehabilitation centers in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, conducted in 2005. Main Outcome Measures: Potentially traumatic war-related experiences assessed via a sample-specific events scale; PTSD symptoms assessed using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (CPTSD-RI), with a score of 35 or higher indicating clinically important PTSD symptoms; and openness to reconciliation and feelings of revenge assessed via structured questionnaires. Results: Children participating in this study were a mean of 15.3 years old. These former child soldiers reported that they had been (violently) recruited by armed forces at a young age (mean [SD], 12.1 [2] years), had served a mean of 38 months (SD, 24 months), and had been demobilized a mean of 2.3 months before data collection (SD, 2.4 months). The children were exposed to a high level of potentially traumatic events (mean [SD], 11.1 [2.99]). The most commonly reported traumatic experiences were having witnessed shooting (92.9\%), having witnessed someone wounded (89.9\%), and having been seriously beaten (84\%). A total of 54.4\% reported having killed someone, and 27.8\% reported that they were forced to engage in sexual contact. Of the 169 interviewed, 59 (34.9\%; 95\% confidence interval, 34.4\%-35.4\%) had a PTSD symptom score higher than 35. Children who showed more PTSD symptoms had significantly less openness to reconciliation ({$\rho$}= -0.34, P {$<$} .001) and more feelings of revenge ({$\rho$}= 0.29, P {$<$} .001). Conclusions: PTSD symptoms are associated with less openness to reconciliation and more feelings of revenge among former Ugandan and Congolese child soldiers. The effect of psychological trauma should be considered when these children are rehabilitated and reintegrated into civilian society. Approximately 250 000 children are being abused as child soldiers in the world today.1 Many of them, often influenced by ethnic tensions, are involved in conflicts in Africa's Great Lakes Region. While enduring their time as soldiers, they undergo and are forced to commit atrocities. Thus, child soldiers carry a special burden of simultaneously being the recipient and perpetrator of violence.2 They are blamed and stigmatized for the atrocities they have committed, and their psychological recovery and reintegration into civilian society is a difficult task. Currently, Africa's Great Lakes Region is struggling to recover from war. Undoubtedly, a key issue to promote the process of reconciliation and reconstruction of society is the successful rehabilitation and social reintegration of the numerous former child soldiers. The psychological rehabilitation of child soldiers is an obligation, according to Article 39 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.3 Despite the large number of children serving as soldiers in armed conflicts, the effect of being a child soldier on the children's mental health has been minimally researched. In 2004, Derluyn et al4 evaluated clinically significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in former Ugandan child soldiers, using the Impact of Event Scale\textendash Revised.5 The authors reported that nearly all children (97\%) showed posttraumatic stress reactions of clinical importance. The question of whether posttraumatic stress might influence the individual's attitude toward reconciliation has been investigated very little. In 2004, Pham et al6 examined this association in 2074 adult survivors of the Rwandan genocide, using the PTSD Checklist\textendash Civilian Version7 and a newly developed reconciliation questionnaire. The investigators demonstrated that traumatic exposure and PTSD symptoms were associated with attitudes toward reconciliation. Therefore, we sought to assess the prevalence of PTSD symptoms in former Ugandan and Congolese child soldiers and to explore how PTSD symptoms are associated with these children's openness to reconciliation and feelings of revenge on the person or group they consider their enemy.},

We controlled for known factors associated with suicidality. Results. Having had a friend who committed suicide increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation and attempts for both boys and girls. Socially isolated females were more likely to have suicidal thoughts, as were females whose friends were not friends with each other. Among adolescents thinking about suicide, suicide attempts appear largely stochastic, with few consistent risk factors between boys and girls. Conclusions. The friendship environment affects suicidality for both boys and girls. Female adolescents' suicidal thoughts are significantly increased by social isolation and friendship patterns in which friends were not friends with each other.},

  abstract = {During the nineteenth century, the United States entered the ranks of the world's most advanced and dynamic economies. At the same time, the nation sustained an expansive and brutal system of human bondage. This was no mere coincidence. Slavery's Capitalism argues for slavery's centrality to the emergence of American capitalism in the decades between the Revolution and the Civil War. According to editors Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman, the issue is not whether slavery itself was or was not capitalist but, rather, the impossibility of understanding the nation's spectacular pattern of economic development without situating slavery front and center. American capitalism\textemdash renowned for its celebration of market competition, private property, and the self-made man\textemdash has its origins in an American slavery predicated on the abhorrent notion that human beings could be legally owned and compelled to work under force of violence.Drawing on the expertise of sixteen scholars who are at the forefront of rewriting the history of American economic development, Slavery's Capitalism identifies slavery as the primary force driving key innovations in entrepreneurship, finance, accounting, management, and political economy that are too often attributed to the so-called free market. Approaching the study of slavery as the originating catalyst for the Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism casts new light on American credit markets, practices of offshore investment, and understandings of human capital. Rather than seeing slavery as outside the institutional structures of capitalism, the essayists recover slavery's importance to the American economic past and prompt enduring questions about the relationship of market freedom to human freedom.Contributors: Edward E.

Studies have found substantial variability across countries in the negative impacts of orphanhood on child health and education. One hypothesis for this variability is the resilience of the extended family network in some countries to care for orphans\textemdash networks under increasing pressure by the sheer number of orphans in many settings. Using household survey data from 21 countries in Africa, this study examines trends in orphanhood and living arrangements, and the links between the two. The findings confirm that orphanhood is increasing, although not all countries are experiencing rapid rises. In many countries, there has been a shift toward grandparents taking an increased childcare responsibility\textemdash especially where orphan rates are growing rapidly. This suggests some merit to the claim that the extended network is narrowing, focusing on grandparents who are older, and may be less able than working-age adults financially to support orphans. However, there are also changes in childcare patterns in countries with stable orphan rates or low HIV prevalence. This suggests that future work on living arrangements should not exclude low HIV/AIDS prevalence countries, and explanations for changes should include a broader set of factors.},

Methods: Analysis of body mass index (BMI), diet, and physical activity from 7,325 urban and 1,490 rural adults in the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Findings: The obesity prevalence was 39.6\% (SE = 1.5) among rural adults compared to 33.4\% (SE = 1.1) among urban adults (P= .006). Prevalence of obesity remained significantly higher among rural compared to urban adults controlling for demographic, diet, and physical activity variables (odds ratio = 1.18, P= .03). Race/ethnicity and percent kcal from fat were significant correlates of obesity among both rural and urban adults. Being married was associated with obesity only among rural residents, whereas older age, less education, and being inactive was associated with obesity only among urban residents. Conclusions: Obesity is markedly higher among adults from rural versus urban areas of the United States, with estimates that are much higher than the rates suggested by studies with self-reported data.

This article adds to the small body of research by drawing on the back translation documentation from the 2012 European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS).

We note inconsistency in the detection of presumed flaws. Second, the back translation outcome is contrasted with additional native speaker checks of the actual translation.

  abstract = {Therapies to extend healthspan are poised to move from laboratory animal models to human clinical trials. Translation from mouse to human will entail challenges, among them the multifactorial heterogeneity of human aging. To inform clinical trials about this heterogeneity, we report how humans' pace of biological aging relates to personal-history characteristics. Because geroprotective therapies must be delivered by midlife to prevent age-related disease onset, we studied young-adult members of the Dunedin Study 1972\textendash 73 birth cohort (n = 954). Cohort members' Pace of Aging was measured as coordinated decline in the integrity of multiple organ systems, by quantifying rate of decline across repeated measurements of 18 biomarkers assayed when cohort members were ages 26, 32, and 38 years. The childhood personal-history characteristics studied were known predictors of age-related disease and mortality, and were measured prospectively during childhood. Personal-history characteristics of familial longevity, childhood social class, adverse childhood experiences, and childhood health, intelligence, and self-control all predicted differences in cohort members' adulthood Pace of Aging. Accumulation of more personal-history risks predicted faster Pace of Aging. Because trials of anti-aging therapies will need to ascertain personal histories retrospectively, we replicated results using cohort members' retrospective personal-history reports made in adulthood. Because many trials recruit participants from clinical settings, we replicated results in the cohort subset who had recent health system contact according to electronic medical records. Quick, inexpensive measures of trial participants' early personal histories can enable clinical trials to study who volunteers for trials, who adheres to treatment, and who responds to anti-aging therapies.},

This review gives a systematic overview of prospective cohort studies investigating chronic psychosocial stress as a risk factor for incident MES and the individual elements of MES. Thirty-nine studies were included. An association between chronic psychosocial stress and the development of MES was generally supported. Regarding the four elements of MES: i) weight gain: the prospective studies supported etiological roles for relationship stress, perceived stress, and distress, while the studies on work-related stress (WS) showed conflicting results; ii) dyslipidemi: too few studies on psychosocial stress as a risk factor for dyslipidemia were available to draw a conclusion; however, a trend toward a positive association was present; iii) type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2): prospective studies supported perceived stress and distress as risk factors for the development of DM2 among men, but not among women, while WS was generally not supported as a risk factor among neither men nor women; iv) hypertension: marital stress and perceived stress might have an influence on blood pressure (BP), while no association was found regarding distress. Evaluating WS the results were equivocal and indicated that different types of WS affected the BP differently between men and women. In conclusion, a longitudinal association between chronic psychosocial stress and the development of MES seems present. However, the number of studies with sufficient quality is limited and the design of the studies is substantially heterogeneous.},

Mental disorders were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Happiness was measured using a single question on how often respondents had felt happy during the past 4 weeks. Of the respondents with a mental disorder 68.4\% reported they had felt often happy, compared to 89.1\% without a disorder. The unhappiness of people with mental disorders is associated with having a mood disorder and impaired emotional and social role functioning. Happiness enhances the changes of recovery from a mental disorder at follow-up. The implications are discussed.}

There is now a substantial body of evidence that indicates that the extent to which social relationships are strong and supportive is related to the health of individuals who live within such social contexts. A review of population-based research on mortality risk over the last 20 years indicates that people who are isolated are at increased mortality risk from a number of causes. More recent studies indicate that social support is particularly related to survival postmyocardial infarction. The pathways that lead from such socioenvironmental exposures to poor health outcomes are likely to be multiple and include behavioral mechanisms and more direct physiologic pathways related to neuroendocrine or immunologic function. For social support to be health promoting, it must provide both a sense of belonging and intimacy and must help people to be more competent and self-efficacious. Acknowledging that health promotion rests on the shoulders not only of individuals but also of their families and communities means that we must commit resources over the next decade to designing, testing, and implementing interventions in this area.},

  abstract = {A rational strategy for the automated detection of artifacts in heart period data is outlined and evaluated. The specific implementation of this approach for heart period data is based on the distribution characteristics of successive heart period differences. Because beat-to-beat differences generated by artifacts are large, relative to normal heart period variability, extreme differences between successive heart periods serve to identify potential artifacts. Critical to this approach are: 1) the derivation of the artifact criterion from the distribution of beat differences of the individual subject, and 2) the use of percentile-based distribution indexes, which are less sensitive to corruption by the presence of artifactual values than are least-squares estimates. The artifact algorithms were able to effectively identify artifactual beats embedded in heart period records, flagging each of the 1494 simulated and actual artifacts in data sets derived from both humans and chimpanzees. At the same time, the artifact algorithms yielded a false alarm rate of less than 0.3\%. Although the present implementation was restricted to heart period data, the outlined approach to artifact detection may also be applicable to other biological signals.},

That's a remarkable change from the Civil Rights era\textemdash but does this public commitment to diversity constitute a civil rights victory? What does diversity mean in contemporary America, and what are the effects of efforts to support it?  Ellen Berrey digs deep into those questions in The Enigma of Diversity. Drawing on six years of fieldwork and historical sources dating back to the 1950s and making extensive use of three case studies from widely varying arenas\textemdash housing redevelopment in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, affirmative action in the University of Michigan's admissions program, and the workings of the human resources department at a Fortune 500 company\textemdash Berrey explores the complicated, contradictory, and even troubling meanings and uses of diversity as it is invoked by different groups for different, often symbolic ends. In each case, diversity affirms inclusiveness, especially in the most coveted jobs and colleges, yet it resists fundamental change in the practices and cultures that are the foundation of social inequality. Berrey shows how this has led racial progress itself to be reimagined, transformed from a legal fight for fundamental rights to a celebration of the competitive advantages afforded by cultural differences.  Powerfully argued and surprising in its conclusions, The Enigma of Diversity reveals the true cost of the public embrace of diversity: the taming of demands for racial justice.},

Without historical understanding of this practice of dispossession--the displacement of Native peoples, the destruction of both the land and land-based communities, ongoing racial division--we are doomed to continue industrialism's assault on both the natural world and every sacred American ideal. Berry writes, "To deal with so great a problem, the best idea may not be to go ahead in our present state of unhealth to more disease and more product development. It may be that our proper first resort should be to history: to see if the truth we need to pursue might be behind us where we have ceased to look." If there is hope for us, this is it: that we honestly face our past and move into a future guided by the natural laws of affection.

  abstract = {Objectives. Racial/ethnic disparities in health in the U.S. have been well described. The field of ``cultural competence'' has emerged as one strategy to address these disparities. Based on a review of the relevant literature, the authors develop a definition of cultural competence, identify key components for intervention, and describe a practical framework for implementation of measures to address racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. Methods. The authors conducted a literature review of academic, foundation, and government publications focusing on sociocultural barriers to care, the level of the health care system at which a given barrier occurs, and cultural competence efforts that address these barriers. Results. Sociocultural barriers to care were identified at the organizational (leadership/workforce), structural (processes of care), and clinical (providerpatient encounter) levels. A framework of cultural competence interventions\textemdash including minority recruitment into the health professions, development of interpreter services and language-appropriate health educational materials, and provider education on cross-cultural issues\textemdash emerged to categorize strategies to address racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. Conclusions. Demographic changes anticipated over the next decade magnify the importance of addressing racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. A framework of organizational, structural, and clinical cultural competence interventions can facilitate the elimination of these disparities and improve care for all Americans.},

The aim of the present article was to provide an up-to-date review of the literature dedicated to the question of burnout\textendash depression overlap. A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, PsycINFO, and IngentaConnect. A total of 92 studies were identified as informing the issue of burnout\textendash depression overlap. The current state of the art suggests that the distinction between burnout and depression is conceptually fragile. It is notably unclear how the state of burnout (i.e., the end stage of the burnout process) is conceived to differ from clinical depression. Empirically, evidence for the distinctiveness of the burnout phenomenon has been inconsistent, with the most recent studies casting doubt on that distinctiveness. The absence of consensual diagnostic criteria for burnout and burnout research's insufficient consideration of the heterogeneity of depressive disorders constitute major obstacles to the resolution of the raised issue. In conclusion, the epistemic status of the seminal, field-dominating definition of burnout is questioned. It is suggested that systematic clinical observation should be given a central place in future research on burnout\textendash depression overlap.},

The author concludes with a discussion of management strategies for minimizing minority vulnerability in privileged professions and the challenges faced when the sources of bias are neither unconscious nor unintended but are instead located at least in part in racially segregated social relations and power differences among professionals who hold formally equivalent positions in a company's job structure.},

  abstract = {This article demonstrates a psychological stress protocol for use in a laboratory setting.  Protocols that allow researchers to study the biological pathways of the stress response in health and disease are fundamental to the progress of research in stress and anxiety.1  Although numerous protocols exist for inducing stress response in the laboratory, many neglect to provide a naturalistic context  or to incorporate aspects of social and psychological stress.  Of psychological stress protocols, meta-analysis suggests that the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is the most useful and appropriate standardized protocol for studies of stress hormone reactivity.2  In the original description of the TSST, researchers sought to design and evaluate a procedure capable of inducing a reliable stress response in the majority of healthy volunteers.3  These researchers found elevations in heart rate, blood pressure and several endocrine stress markers in response to the TSST (a psychological stressor) compared to a saline injection (a physical stressor).3  Although the TSST has been modified to meet the needs of various research groups, it generally consists of a waiting period upon arrival, anticipatory speech preparation, speech performance, and verbal arithmetic performance periods, followed by one or more recovery periods.  The TSST requires participants to prepare and deliver a speech, and verbally respond to a challenging arithmetic problem in the presence of a socially evaluative audience.3  Social evaluation and uncontrollability have been identified as key components of stress induction by the TSST.4  In use for over a decade, the goal of the TSST is to systematically induce a stress response in order to measure differences in reactivity, anxiety and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) or sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis during the task.1  Researchers generally assess changes in self-reported anxiety, physiological measures (e.g. heart rate), and/or neuroendocrine indices (e.g. the stress hormone cortisol) in response to the TSST.  Many investigators have adopted salivary sampling for stress markers such as cortisol and alpha-amylase (a marker of autonomic nervous system activation) as an alternative to blood sampling to reduce the confounding stress of blood-collection techniques.  In addition to changes experienced by an individual completing the TSST, researchers can compare changes between different treatment groups (e.g. clinical versus healthy control samples) or the effectiveness of stress-reducing interventions.1},

Despite the importance of caregiving, it can be overwhelming and stressful. Much of the available literature addresses the burdens of caregiving, without addressing the positive characteristics that caregivers need to deliver care in residences for OSC. This study's objective was to identify the desirable characteristics of caregivers through qualitative interviews with directors of residences for OSC across four countries: Cambodia, Ethiopia, India and Kenya. A total of 28 interviews were conducted in the directors' local languages. Interviews were transcribed, translated into English, and analyzed using NVivo software. A thematic analysis of the data yielded three domains: personal qualities, skills, and religion. Across all the study geographic regions, most participants looked for similar characteristics in caregivers, such as love, patience, teamwork and communication skills, especially communicating about difficult child behaviors. These findings can inform plans to enhance effective and sustainable caregiving at residential care sites for OSC and simultaneously benefit the well-being of caregivers. Residential care directors may consider organizing workshops on teamwork and communication skills that will help improve the quality of caregiving.},

Labor market institutions, chiefly the relatively decentralized wage-setting mechanisms in the United States, provide the most persuasive explanation for these patterns.},

The pss seeks to measure one's appraisal of stress, helplessness and self-efficacy. We determined how Christian clergy might respond to the pss by conducting cognitive interview testing with a sample of twelve United Methodist pastors. Interviews were audiotaped and summarized, with content analysis conducted on the summaries. Data saturation was achieved. Participants reported strong negative reactions to pss language like `upset' and `angered'. Although the pss considers higher perceived control to be indicative of less stress, participants reported that they consider accepting lack of control as a sign of faith. Participants reported fears of being poorly regarded as religious leaders upon endorsing items like lack of ability to `handle personal problems'. Participants indicated that their theological beliefs of seeking God's way and being faithful conflicted with items such as `things are going your way' and `you could not overcome'. When answered by Christian pastors, the majority of pss items may be subject to under-reporting and response bias. Future research should identify valid stress measures for Christian clergy and assess the validity of the pss in non-clergy Christian populations.},

We explored congregational and community norms and attitudes regarding HIV, sexuality, and drug use through a qualitative case study of 14 diverse religious congregations in Los Angeles County, California between December 2006 and May 2008. Data collected included semi-structured interviews with 57 clergy and lay leaders across the congregations, structured observations of congregational activities, review of archival documents, and a questionnaire on congregational characteristics. Across and within congregations, we found a wide range of views towards HIV, people with HIV, and populations at risk for HIV, from highly judgmental and exclusionary, to ``loving the sinner, not the sin,'' to accepting and affirming. Attitudes and norms about HIV, homosexuality, and substance abuse appeared to be related to the type and intensity of congregational HIV-related activities. However, even among the higher activity congregations, we found a range of perceptions, including ones that were stigmatizing. Results suggest that affirming norms and attitudes are not a prerequisite for a congregation to initiate HIV activities, a finding relevant for HIV service providers and researchers seeking to engage congregations on this issue. HIV stigma reduction is not a prerequisite for congregational HIV involvement: both may occur simultaneously, or one before the other, and they dynamically affect each other. Strategies that are congruent with congregations' current levels of comfort and openness around HIV can themselves facilitate a process of attitudinal and normative change.},

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

Drawing on the General Social Survey--a social science project that has tracked demographic and attitudinal trends in the United States since 1972--it offers a window into diverse facets of American life, from intergroup relations to political views and orientations, social affiliations, and perceived well-being. Among the book's many important findings are the greater willingness of ordinary Americans to accord rights of free expression to unpopular groups, to endorse formal racial equality, and to accept nontraditional roles for women in the workplace, politics, and the family. Some, but not all, signs indicate that political conservatism has grown, while a few suggest that Republicans and Democrats are more polarized. Some forms of social connectedness such as neighboring have declined, as has confidence in government, while participation in organized religion has softened. Despite rising standards of living, American happiness levels have changed little, though financial and employment insecurity has risen over three decades. Social Trends in American Life provides an invaluable perspective on how Americans view their lives and their society, and on how these views have changed over the last two generations.},

Participants from the Midlife in the United States study self-reported their optimism, satisfaction, positive affect, and socioeconomic status (gender, race/ethnicity, education, occupational class and prestige, income). Social disparities in optimism were evident. Optimistic individuals tended to be white and highly educated, had an educated parent, belonged to higher occupational classes with more prestige, and had higher incomes. Findings were generally similar for satisfaction, but not positive affect. Greater optimism and satisfaction were also associated with educational achievement across generations. Optimism and life satisfaction are consistently linked with socioeconomic advantage and may be one conduit by which social disparities influence health.},

Utilizing twenty-three years of longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1984e2007), this study uses multilevel growth curve models to examine how multiple dimensions of socioeconomic well-beingdincluding long-term economic history and differential returns to SESdcontribute to the life course patterning of Black-White health disparities across two critical markers of well-being: body mass index (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 9057) and self-rated health (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 11,329). Findings indicate that long-term SES exerts a significant influence on both body mass index and selfrated health, net of point-in-time measures, and that Black-White health gaps are smallest in models that adjust for both long-term and current SES. I also find that Blacks and Whites receive differential health returns to increases in SES, which suggests that other factorsdsuch as neighborhood segregation and exposure racial discriminationdmay restrict Blacks from converting increases in SES into health improvements in the same way as Whites. Together, these processes contribute to the life course patterning of Black-White health gaps and raise concerns about previous misestimation of the role of SES in racial health disparities.},

Multivariate analyses demonstrate that antipathy has religious as well as political sources. It is pervasive among the highly educated and among seculars. And recently, cultural progressivism has also become a significant predictor of antipathy. Antifundamentalism has declined among religiously conservative Catholics and Protestants, cultural traditionalists, and self-reported Republicans. Beginning in 1992, attitudes toward this religious group have become polarized. These results have implications for the American party system and religious pluralism.},

We compare these IC measures to common fit indices in a simulation that includes the true and false models. In moderate to large samples, the IC measures outperform the fit indices. In a second simulation we only consider the IC measures and do not include the true model. In moderate to large samples the IC measures favor approximate models that only differ from the true model by having extra parameters. Overall, SPBIC, a new IC measure, performs well relative to the other IC measures.},

We estimated prevalence and prevalence ratios (PRs) by occupational groups adjusting for demographics, occupational physical activity level, smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, and leisure-time physical activity (LPTA). Results Overall obesity prevalence was 24.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 24.0\textendash 25.1). Workers in protective services were 2.46 (95\% CI, 1.72\textendash 3.50) times as likely to be obese as workers in health diagnosing occupations. Compared with their counterparts, workers who consumed adequate amounts of fruits and vegetables and had adequate LTPA were significantly less likely to be obese (PR = 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.86\textendash 0.97 and PR = 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.60\textendash 0.67, respectively). Workers with physically demanding occupational physical activity had a lower PR of obesity (PR = 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.78\textendash 0.88) than those with nonphysically demanding occupational physical activity. Conclusion Obesity prevalence and health risk behaviors vary substantially by occupation. Employers, policy makers, and health promotion practitioners can use our results to target and prioritize workplace obesity prevention and health behavior promotion programs.},

  abstract = {Racism has always been ``more than prejudice,'' but mainstream social analysts have mostly framed race matters as organized by the logic of prejudice. In this paper, I do four things. First, I restate my criticism of the dominant approach to race matters and emphasize the need to ground our racial analysis materially, that is, understanding that racism is systemic and rooted in differences in power between the races. Second, I reflect critically on my own theorization on race (the racialized social system approach) and acknowledge that I should have explained better the role of culture and ideology in the making and remaking of race. Third, I describe some of the work I have done since this early work. Fourth, I advance several new directions for research and theory in the field of race stratification.},

More importantly, we investigate whether either type of pooling is related to the sharing of expenditures between the two partners, and whether there are different correlations between the income distribution and the sharing of expenditures among double-career couples and other couples. We find that in most households the income distribution is correlated with the sharing of consumption\textemdash the economic approach\textemdash and that this holds true even if the household pools its resources\textemdash the economic psychology approach, implying that there is no strong relationship between the two approaches.},

  abstract = {Background: Cognitive dysfunction in major depressive disorder (MDD) encompasses several domains, including but not limited to executive function, verbal memory, and attention. Furthermore, cognitive dysfunction is a frequent residual manifestation in depression and may persist during the remitted phase. Cognitive deficits may also impede functional recovery, including workforce performance, in patients with MDD. The overarching aims of this opinion article are to critically evaluate the effects of available antidepressants as well as novel therapeutic targets on neurocognitive dysfunction in MDD. Discussion: Conventional antidepressant drugs mitigate cognitive dysfunction in some people with MDD. However, a significant proportion of MDD patients continue to experience significant cognitive impairment. Two multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant, has significant precognitive effects in MDD unrelated to mood improvement. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was shown to alleviate executive dysfunction in an RCT of adults after full or partial remission of MDD. Preliminary evidence also indicates that erythropoietin may alleviate cognitive dysfunction in MDD. Several other novel agents may be repurposed as cognitive enhancers for MDD treatment, including minocycline, insulin, antidiabetic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, S-adenosyl methionine, acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, modafinil, galantamine, scopolamine, N-acetylcysteine, curcumin, statins, and coenzyme Q10. Summary: The management of cognitive dysfunction remains an unmet need in the treatment of MDD. However, it is hoped that the development of novel therapeutic targets will contribute to `cognitive remission', which may aid functional recovery in MDD.},

In this article, we develop a theoretical model of cultural schemas that is better able to support empirical work, including inferential, sensitizing, and operational uses. We propose a multilevel framework centered on a high-level definition of cultural schemas that is sufficiently broad to capture its major sociological applications but still sufficiently narrow to identify a set of cognitive phenomena with key functional properties in common: cultural schemas are socially shared representations deployable in automatic cognition. We use this conception to elaborate the main theoretical properties of cultural schemas, and to provide clear criteria that distinguish them from other cultural or cognitive elements. We then propose a series of concrete tests empirical scholarship can use to determine if these properties apply. We also demonstrate how this approach can identify potentially faulty theoretical inferences present in existing work. Moving to a lower level of analysis, we elaborate how cultural schemas can be algorithmically conceptualized in terms of their building blocks. This leads us to recommend improvements to methods for measuring cultural schemas. We conclude by outlining questions for a broader research program.},

  abstract = {Background: Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but it remains unclear which component\textemdash alone or in combination\textemdash is the best predictor. We sought to determine which BP parameters are important predictors of CVD death across a wide age range. Methods: We used a prospective cohort study design with 53,163 men followed for cause-specific death during a median of 5.7 years in the Physicians' Health Study enrollment cohort. Baseline age, systolic BP and diastolic BP were collected. We calculated relative risks (RRs) and their 95\% confidence intervals using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for major risk factors for CVD, and then stratified by age (39 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 84 years). Results: There were 459 CVD deaths during follow-up. For each 10 mm Hg increase in systolic BP, the multivariable RRs by ascending age group were 1.46, 1.43, 1.24, and 1.13. The multivariable RRs for each 10 mm Hg increase in diastolic BP were 1.25, 1.20, 1.28, and 1.07. Compared with systolic BP, pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure were not consistent predictors across age ranges, and combining systolic BP with another parameter did not improve the model compared with using systolic BP alone in any age group (all P Ͼ .05). Conclusions: In this large cohort of healthy men with no history of hypertension, systolic BP was the most consistent and significant predictor of CVD death across all ages. Diastolic BP was not as strongly associated with risk. Our results support the continuing emphasis on using systolic BP in predicting cardiovascular risk.

Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.},

Scholars have proposed several explanations for this trend, disagreeing about whether it is the result of a particular cultural moment or an ongoing process leading to even greater religious decline. Voas (2009) proposed one such explanation. He used European data to show that the proportion of nonreligious people in each cohort only became significant when previous cohorts reached a critical mass of moderately religious people. Voas's model is novel and promising but has neither been examined statistically nor applied to U.S. data, which I take up here. I find that, surprisingly, the United States fits closely on the same trajectory of religious decline as European countries, suggesting a shared demographic process as opposed to idiosyncratic change. I conclude by discussing how these findings inform theories of self-reinforcing religious decline and cross-national patterns of religiosity.},

Potential benefits include increased organizational innovation, legitimacy, and strategic capacity; challenges include threats to organizational stability, efficacy, and survival. In this article, we analyze the dynamics of internal diversity within a field of politically oriented civic organizations. We find that ``bridging cultural practices'' serve as a key mechanism through which racially and socioeconomically diverse organizations navigate challenges generated by internal differences. Drawing on data from extended ethnographic fieldwork within one local faith-based community organizing coalition, we describe how particular prayer practices are used to bridge differences within group settings marked by diversity. Furthermore, using data from a national study of all faithbased community organizing coalitions in the United States, we find that a coalition's prayer practices are associated with its objective level of racial and socioeconomic diversity and its subjective perception of challenges arising from such diversity.

This study extends the current body of research by pursuing the following question: Are Americans the only overreporters, or is this a ubiquitous survey artifact inherent to conventional survey measures of religious service attendance? Overreporting is estimated as the difference between directive measures from conventional surveys and those from time diaries. The survey artifact is examined across 14 countries and over four decades, highlighting the consistency and extremeness of (over)reported American religious participation, in light of concordance between modes in other countries. Findings suggest that American religiosity may be exceptional not in terms of actual behavior, but rather in terms of identity. As a result, this study adds to our understanding of American exceptionalism by drawing a distinction between religious identities and religious behavior.},

The 2005 Canadian General Social Survey contains observed measures of attendance from both a conventional survey question and a time diary, allowing a direct and rigorous test of the identity explanation. Findings suggest that rates of Canadian overreporting, at about 50 percent, rival rates of overreporting in the United States. Moreover, like overreporting in the United States, Canadian overreporting may be affected by an identity process during the survey interview. Finally, implications for measuring religiosity in both countries are discussed.},

A time diary measure of attendance (from the American Time Use Study 2003\textendash 2008) is imputed for conventional survey data (from the General Social Survey 2002\textendash 2008) using the multiple imputation for multiple studies procedure (Gelman, King, and Liu 1998a). Logistic regression models predicting self-reported attendance and overreported attendance are estimated using identity importance as a key covariate and controlling for demographic variables associated with attendance.

One key point of polarization behind this phenomenon is sexuality-focused politics, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) rights and discrimination. The current research uses a split-ballot survey experiment to investigate sexualityfocused political polarization as a cause of the reports of religious nonaffiliation. A sample of 2,238 respondents, stratified by sexual orientation (half LGBQ, half straight), completed a brief web survey starting with two randomly ordered series of questions on religion and sexuality. Findings suggest that sexuality-focused political polarization is not likely to be a primary cause of survey respondents' claims of religious nonaffiliation.},

There is a critical need to identify cost effective community resources that optimize stress resilience. Faith-based communities may promote forgiveness rather than retaliation, opportunities for cathartic emotional release, and social support, all of which have been related to neurobiology, behavior, and health outcomes. While spirituality and religion can be related to guilt, neurotic, and psychotic disorders, they also can be powerful sources of hope, meaning, peace, comfort, and forgiveness for the self and others.

The idea came from the realization that there had been no attempt to bring together the various literatures on the topic. Discrimination and issues of employment diversity are significant topics today in IO psychology, business, and human resource management. This edited volume examines the following components of this important discussion:  how to explain discrimination in organizations; understanding discrimination against specific groups; and implications for practical efforts to reduce discrimination. This book brings together, in one volume, a review of the research on discrimination based on race, age, sexual orientation, gender, physical appearance, disability, and personality. In addition, it explores the multilevel antecedents and potential bases for a general model of discrimination in the workplace. While social psychological research and theory have provided invaluable insights, an understanding of discrimination in the workplace and solutions will require incorporating factors at the organizational level in addition to factors at the individual and group levels. Although a definitive model is not reached, the aim of this text is to facilitate future research and theory.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare estimates of population levels of 'adequate activity' for health benefit in different age and sex groups using two different measures--kilocalories (kcals) and Mets.mins. METHODS: 10,464 mid-age women (47-52 years) from the second survey of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH, 1998) and 2,500 men and women (18-75 years) from the 1997 Active Australia national survey, answered questions about physical activity. Kcals and Mets.mins were calculated from self-reported time spent in walking, moderate and vigorous activity, and self-reported body weight. 'Adequate activity' was defined as a minimum of 800 kcals or 600 Mets.mins. RESULTS: There were differences in the estimates of 'adequate activity' using the two methods among women participants in both surveys, but not among the male participants in the Active Australia survey. A significant proportion of the women in both surveys (6.4\% of the ALSWH women and 8.5\% of the Active Australia women, mean weight 60 kg) were classified as 'inactive' when the kcals method was used despite reporting levels of activity commensurate with good health. Fewer than 1\% (mean weight 105 kg) were classified as 'active' using kcals when reporting lower than recommended levels of activity. Agreement between the two methods was better among men; only 3\% were misclassified because of low or very high weight. CONCLUSIONS: The Mets.mins method of estimating 'adequate' activity assesses physical activity independently of body weight and is recommended for use in future population surveys, as it is less likely to under-estimate the prevalence of physical activity in women. IMPLICATIONS: Women and men aged 45-59 and women aged {$>$} 60 should be the target of specific health promotion strategies to increase population levels of physical activity.},

Our Bayesian methods use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation, with adaptive hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs sampling for RELR models, and several diffuse prior distributions ({$\Gamma-$}1( , ) and U (0, 1 ) priors for variance components). For evaluation criteria we consider bias of point estimates and nominal versus actual coverage of interval estimates in repeated sampling. In two-level VC models we find that (a) both likelihood-based and Bayesian approaches can be made to produce approximately unbiased estimates, although the automatic manner in which REML accomplishes this is an advantage, but (b) both approaches had difficulty achieving nominal coverage in small samples and with small values of the intraclass correlation. With the threelevel RELR models we examine we find that (c) quasi-likelihood methods for estimating random-effects variances perform badly with respect to bias and coverage in the example we simulated, and (d) Bayesian diffuse-prior methods lead to wellcalibrated point and interval RELR estimates. While it is true that the likelihoodbased methods we study are considerably faster computationally than MCMC, (i) steady improvements in recent years in both hardware speed and efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms and (ii) the lack of calibration of likelihood-based methods in some common hierarchical settings combine to make MCMC-based Bayesian fitting of multilevel models an attractive approach, even with rather large data sets. Other analytic strategies based on less approximate likelihood methods are also possible but would benefit from further study of the type summarized here.},

  abstract = {Objective~         Heart rate variability (HRV) is a marker of autonomic nervous system function associated with both physical and mental health. Many studies have suggested that mindfulness and meditation-based interventions (MBIs) are associated with improvements in HRV, but findings are mixed, and to date, no comprehensive meta-analysis has synthesized results.         Methods~         Systematic literature searches were conducted using PsycINFO, Embase, Medline, CINAHL, ERIC, and Scopus to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of predominantly seated MBIs on resting-state vagally mediated HRV. Risk of bias was judged using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.         Results~         Nineteen RCTs met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis found that MBIs were not efficacious in increasing vagally mediated resting-state HRV relative to control conditions (Hedges g = 0.38, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = -0.014 to 0.77). When removing an outlier (g = 3.22), the effect size was reduced, CI narrowed, and findings remained nonsignificant (g = 0.19, 95\% CI = -0.02 to 0.39). High heterogeneity in results (I2 = 89.12\%) could not be explained by a priori\textendash determined moderators including intervention duration, study setting, and control type.         Conclusions~         There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate that MBIs lead to improvements in vagally mediated HRV over control conditions. Future large, well-designed RCTs with low risk of methodological bias could help add to the current evidence to elucidate any role MBIs might play in impacting HRV.},

Method: A sample of male and female teachers and students was recruited from four sites of a tertiary education institution to a series of focus groups. A grounded theory approach to qualitative data analysis was used to elucidate men's experience of depression. Content analysis was applied to the women's data to examine similarities and contrasts with the men. Standard measures of mood and dispositional optimism confirmed the non-clinical status of the group. Results: The findings suggest that some men who are depressed can experience a trajectory of emotional distress manifest in avoidant, numbing and escape behaviours which can lead to aggression, violence and suicide. Gender differences appear not in the experience of depression per se, but in the expression of depression. Conclusion: Emotional distress, constrained by traditional notions of masculinity, may explain why depression in men can often be hidden, overlooked, not discussed or `acted out'. There are implications for the types of questions asked of men to detect depressive symptoms.},

The tobit part of the model explores the determinants of the amount donated by each household conditional on being in that class. We extend the standard latent class tobit panel approach to simultaneously include random effects, to allow for heteroskedasticity and to incorporate the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation of the dependent variable. Our findings, which are based on U.S. panel data drawn from five waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, suggest two distinct classes of donators. There is a clear disparity between the probabilities of zero donations across these classes, with one class dominated by the observed zero givers and associated with relatively low levels of predicted giving. We find clear evidence of both heteroskedasticity and random effects. In addition, all IHS parameters were significantly different from zero and different across classes. In combination, these findings endorse the importance of our three modelling extensions and suggest that treating the population as a single homogeneous group of donors, as is common in the existing literature, may lead to biased parameter estimates and erroneous policy inference. Although we use this model to explain charitable donations, we note that it has wide applicability for researchers across the social sciences.},

We find that citizenship question response patterns in the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that it is a sensitive question when asked about administrative record noncitizens but not when asked about administrative record citizens. ACS respondents who were administrative record noncitizens in 2017 frequently choose to skip the question or answer that the person is a citizen. We predict the effect on self-response to the entire survey by comparing mail response rates in the 2010 ACS, which included a citizenship question, with those of the 2010 census, which did not have a citizenship question, among households in both surveys. We compare the actual ACS\textendash census difference in response rates for households that may contain noncitizens (more sensitive to the question) with the difference for households containing only U.S. citizens. We estimate that the addition of a citizenship question will have an 8.0 percentage point larger effect on self-response rates in households that may have noncitizens relative to those with only U.S. citizens. Assuming that the citizenship question does not affect unit self-response in all-citizen households and applying the 8.0 percentage point drop to the 28.1~\% of housing units potentially having at least one noncitizen would predict an overall 2.2 percentage point drop in self-response in the 2020 census, increasing costs and reducing the quality of the population count.},

In the second part, I specify the structural trends and the conjunctural convergence of a series of crises that jointly explain the clustering in space and time that constitutes the populist moment. The question in my title is thus twofold: it is a question about populism as a term or concept and a question about populism as a phenomenon in the world.

To advance this literature, we take up three outstanding questions related to selection bias, the distinction between universal and targeted programs, and the types of authority relations most likely to foster engagement among the poor. Using a longitudinal dataset from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, which follows a cohort of low-income parents and their newborn children in 20 U.S. cities, we estimate effects associated with three types of means-tested public assistance. We find that these policies' effects are not an illusion created by selection bias; the effects of targeted programs can both promote and discourage engagement; and such effects tend to be more positive when a policy's authority structure reflects democratic rather than paternalist principles.},

One hundred and eleven patients were successfully followed up in the same manner, typically 4 months later. Social networks were very stable over time. Where they did change, this could not be explained in terms of losses of social contact due to events such as death of a primary group member. The rating of threatening events and difficulties was also unrelated to the quality of social support networks. Institutional rearing in childhood was associated with substantially smaller adult primary networks. It was concluded that over short periods of time, measures based on the LEDS and IMSR are independent, but that major social disruptions may have life long effects on social support networks.},

Doing so allowed those participants to provide more ideologically consistent responses to 41 survey questions, creating a strikingly bimodal distribution of reported opinion by pulling moderate answers to the political right. Quantile regression confirms these results. Probable cheating also increased the effect of Internet news source bias. These findings suggest that in-themoment Internet messages can influence reported opinions, not because Internet media consumers are duped, but because online information empowers them to give answers consistent with dominant political schemata in survey options and online information.},

Methods: Nine hundred eighteen older Catholic clergy participating in the Religious Orders Study without dementia at baseline were studied. Outcome measures were the clinical diagnosis of AD and change in cognitive function. Results: During a mean follow-up of 5.5 years, 151 persons developed AD. BMI averaged 27.4 at baseline and declined in about half the participants. In a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and education, each 1-unit less of BMI at baseline was associated with about a 5\% increase in the risk of AD (hazard ratio ϭ 0.944; 95\% CI ϭ 0.908 to 0.981), and each 1-unit annual decline in BMI (about the 10th percentile) was associated with about a 35\% increase in the risk of AD compared with a person experiencing no change in BMI (about the 50th percentile) (hazard ratio ϭ 0.730; 95\% CI ϭ 0.625 to 0.852). The results were similar after controlling for chronic diseases and excluding persons who developed AD during the first 4 years of observation. Random effects models showed that the rate of cognitive decline increased by about 8\% for each 1-unit less of BMI at baseline and declined an additional 40\%/year in persons losing 1 unit of BMI/year compared with those with no change in BMI. Conclusion: Declining body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased risk of incident Alzheimer disease (AD). Loss of BMI may reflect pathologic processes that contribute to the subsequent development of AD.},

  abstract = {In this review, we touch on a broad array of ways that work is linked to health and health disparities for individuals and societies. First focusing on the health of individuals, we discuss the health differences between those who do and do not work for pay, and review key positive and negative exposures that can generate health disparities among the employed. These include both psychosocial factors like the benefits of a high-status job or the burden of perceived job insecurity, as well as physical exposures to dangerous working conditions like asbestos or rotating shift work. We also provide a discussion of the ways differential exposure to these aspects of work contributes to social disparities in health within and across generations. Analytic complexities in assessing the link between work and health for individuals, such as health selection, are also discussed. We then touch on several contextual-level associations between work and the health of populations, discussing the importance of the occupational structure in a given society, the policy environment that prevails there, and the oscillations of the macroeconomy for generating societal disparities in health. We close with a discussion of four areas and associated recommendations that draw on this corpus of knowledge but would push the research on work, health, and inequality toward even greater scholarly and policy relevance.},

  abstract = {Background\hspace{0.6em} RELTRAD is the most popular and widely used classification scheme for sorting religious traditions in the social sciences, however it struggles with how to sort non-denominational Protestants into one of the existing categories, with a growing number falling into an often ignored ``unclassified'' category. Purpose\hspace{0.6em}To demonstrate the growing problem of excluding non-denominational protestants who attend infrequently in the current iteration of RELTRAD. We assess the assumption that the ``unclassified'' respondents are akin to those who select a ``don't know'' option and should be excluded. We also propose several ways to reintroduce low attending non-denominationals back into the larger sample. Methods\hspace{0.6em} As a means to assess the political and religious characteristics of these ``unclassified'' respondents, we compare non-denominationals to a prototypical evangelical denomination\textemdash the Southern Baptist Convention and a prototypical mainline denomination\textemdash the United Methodist Church using General Social Survey data from 2000 to 2018. We also re-run models of social and political phenomena, originally shown by Steensland et al. (Soc Forces 79:291, 2000), with the new and old RELTRAD categories. Results\hspace{0.6em} Analyses indicate that non-denominational Protestants who attend church at least once a month have similar characteristics to evangelicals, justifying their current classification. However, non-denominationals who attend less frequently are more difficult to sort cleanly as they are more conservative than United Methodists but more liberal than Southern Baptists. However, the gaps caused by attendance among the three groups is comparable, undermining the RELTRAD assumption that low attending non-denominationals should be excluded from the sample. Conclusions and Implications\hspace{0.6em} We reject the decision to exclude low attending nondenominationals from samples. Combined with other analyses of non-denominational Christians that show differences by denominationalism, we conclude that the best way forward may be creating an entirely new RELTRAD category for nondenominational Protestants that would solve the problem of the unclassifieds and not lose measure specificity. This choice brings new questions into focus as researchers can acknowledge the rapidly growing non-denominational category and assess the},

This paper provides practical guidance to researchers who want to measure or analyze evangelicals. In the social sciences, many have adopted a detailed religious affiliation approach that categorizes evangelicals based on the religious tradition of the denominations to which they belong. Others have used a simpler self-identification scheme, which asks respondents if they consider themselves ``born-again or evangelical''. While the affiliation and self-identification schemes are predominant, a practical examination of these approaches has been absent. Using several waves of the General Social Survey and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we compare them. We find almost no statistical differences between the two measurements in prominent demographic, political, or religious factors. Thus, we suggest that for most a simple question about broad religious affiliation followed by a born-again or evangelical self-identification question will suffice.},

  abstract = {Background The cross-lagged panel (regression) model (CLPM) is the usual framework of choice to test the longitudinal reciprocal effects between self-concept and achievement. Criticisms of the CLPM are that causal paths are over-estimated as they fail to discriminate between- and within-person variation. The random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is one alternative that extends the CLPM by partialling out between-person variance. Aims We compare analyses from a CLPM and a RI-CLPM which examine the reciprocal relationships between self-concept, self-efficacy, and achievement and determine the extent CLPM estimates are inflated by between-person variance. Sample(s) Participants (n = 314) were first-year undergraduate psychology students recruited as part of the STudent Engagement with Education and Learning (STEEL) project. Methods Participants completed measures of self-efficacy and self-concept prior to completing fortnightly quiz assessments. Results Cross-Lagged Panel (regression) Model estimates are likely over-estimated in comparison with RI-CLPM estimates. Cross-Lagged Panel (regression) Model analyses identified a reciprocal effects relationship between self-concept and achievement, confirming established literature. In RI-CLPM analyses, these effects were attenuated and a skill development association between achievement and self-concept was supported. A reciprocal relationship between self-efficacy and achievement was supported. Better model fit was reported for the RI-CLPM analyses. Conclusions Prior findings relating to the reciprocal effects of self-concept and achievement need to be reconsidered. Whilst such a relationship was supported in a CLPM analysis in this study, within an RI-CLPM framework, only achievement predicted self-concept. However, in both CLPM and RI-CLPM models a reciprocal effects model of self-efficacy and achievement was supported.},

  abstract = {Much of the research in epidemiology and clinical science is based upon longitudinal designs which involve repeated measurements of a variable of interest in each of a series of individuals. Such designs can be very powerful, both statistically and scientifically, because they enable one to study changes within individual subjects over time or under varied conditions. However, this power arises because the repeated measurements tend to be correlated with one another, and this must be taken into proper account at the time of analysis or misleading conclusions may result. Recent advances in statistical theory and in software development mean that studies based upon such designs can now be analysed more easily, in a valid yet flexible manner, using a variety of approaches which include the use of generalized estimating equations, and mixed models which incorporate random effects. This paper provides a particularly simple illustration of the use of these two approaches, taking as a practical example the analysis of a study which examined the response of portable peak expiratory flow meters to changes in true peak expiratory flow in 12 children with asthma. The paper takes the reader through the relevant practicalities of model fitting, interpretation and criticism and demonstrates that, in a simple case such as this, analyses based upon these model-based approaches produce reassuringly similar inferences to standard analyses based upon more conventional methods. 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Best predictors of spiritual dryness were the (lack of) perception of the transcendent, (low) sense of coherence, depressive symptoms and emotional exhaustion.

Priests' living situation, social support, lack of social network, self-efficacy expectation, the depersonalization component of burnout, stress perception, and neuroticism were not among the significant predictors in this model.

Our review focuses on effect sizes that contrast outcomes for CBT with outcomes for various control groups for each disorder, which provides an overview of the effectiveness of cognitive therapy as quantified by meta-analysis. Large effect sizes were found for CBT for unipolar depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and childhood depressive and anxiety disorders. Effect sizes for CBT of marital distress, anger, childhood somatic disorders, and chronic pain were in the moderate range. CBT was somewhat superior to antidepressants in the treatment of adult depression. CBT was equally effective as behavior therapy in the treatment of adult depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Large uncontrolled effect sizes were found for bulimia nervosa and schizophrenia. The 16 meta-analyses we reviewed support the efficacy of CBT for many disorders. While limitations of the meta-analytic approach need to be considered in interpreting the results of this review, our findings are consistent with other review methodologies that also provide support for the efficacy CBT.

These evangelicals raise a starkly consequential question for electoral politics: Why do they claim morality while supporting politicians who act immorally by most Christian measures? In this clear-eyed, hard-hitting chronicle of American religion and politics, Anthea Butler answers that racism is at the core of conservative evangelical activism and power.Butler reveals how evangelical racism, propelled by the benefits of whiteness, has since the nation's founding played a provocative role in severely fracturing the electorate. During the buildup to the Civil War, white evangelicals used scripture to defend slavery and nurture the Confederacy. During Reconstruction, they used it to deny the vote to newly emancipated blacks. In the twentieth century, they sided with segregationists in avidly opposing movements for racial equality and civil rights. Most recently, evangelicals supported the Tea Party, a Muslim ban, and border policies allowing family separation. White evangelicals today, cloaked in a vision of Christian patriarchy and nationhood, form a staunch voting bloc in support of white leadership. Evangelicalism's racial history festers, splits America, and needs a reckoning now.},

We assessed obesity prevalence rates and their trends among major US occupational groups. Methods. Self-reported weight and height were collected annually on US workers, aged 18 years or older, from the 1986 to 1995 and the 1997 to 2002 National Health Interview Surveys. Overall, occupation-, race-, and gender-specific rates of obesity (defined as a body mass index {$>$} 30.0 kg/m2) were calculated with data pooled from both study periods (n {$>$} 600 000). Annual occupation-specific prevalence rates were also calculated, and their time trends were assessed. Results. Obesity rates increased significantly over time among employed workers, irrespective of race and gender. The average yearly change increased from 0.61\% ({$\pm$}.04) during the period from 1986 to 1995 to 0.95\% ({$\pm$}.11) during the period from 1997 to 2002. Average obesity prevalence rates and corresponding trends varied considerably across occupational groups; pooled obesity prevalence rates were highest in motor vehicle operators (31.7\% in men; 31.0\% in women). Conclusions. Weight loss intervention programs targeting workers employed in occupational groups with high or increasing rates of obesity are urgently needed.

We analyze these case studies to demonstrate the different ways religion influences immigrants' adaptation in the United States. We then consider how religion informs immigrants' ethnic and gender-based identities, their experiences of civic and political life, and the lives of the second generation. We argue that current research is more descriptive than analytic overall, and we highlight a series of research questions and comparisons to enrich theoretical thinking. In particular, we advocate a comparative approach to examining immigrants' religious organizations and increased attention to a ``lived religion'' perspective, which takes seriously the ways religion is important for immigrants outside of religious organizations in social institutions, including civic organizations, families, workplaces, schools, and health-care organizations.},

  abstract = {Faced with a minimally participatory democracy, a variety of populists have sought to revitalize popular political participation by strengthening local community mobilizations. Others have called for reliance on frequent referenda. Assessing the limits of these proposals requires theoretical attention to two key issues. The first is the growing importance of very large scale patterns of societal integration which depend on indirect social relationships achieved through communications media, markets and bureaucracies. This split of system world from lifeworld, in Habermas's terms, poses a challenge to democratic theories which assume that the lessons of local social life and political participation are directly translatable into the necessary knowledge for state level (let alone international) activity. Secondly, changes in patterns of community formation and communications media have transformed the basis for democracy. In particular, socio-spatial segmentation by life-style choice, market position and other factors limits direct relationships increasingly to similar individuals. Mass media become increasingly predominant sources of information about people different from oneself, and indirect social relationships form the structural basis for the social integration of most politics. The present paper revised and adapts Habermas's conceptualization of system world and lifeworld in order to address the transformation of patterns of societal integration. This forms the basis for a critical analysis of the implications of changing community form and especially communications media for populist political proposals.},

We examine gender differences in weight status, measured by BMI and obesity, by social integration and income, and find evidence that high social integration is a risk factor for higher weight status among low-income men. The association between income and higher weight status operates differently for women and men and is dependent, in part, on their level of social integration. Income is negatively associated with weight status for men who are highly integrated, but is positively associated with weight status among men who have low integration. We conclude that higher numbers of close friends and family places low-income men at greater risk of higher weight status.},

This book examines the political causes and political consequences of this secular surge, drawing on a wealth of original data. The authors show that secular identity is in part a reaction to the Religious Right. However, while the political impact of secularism is profound, there may not yet be a Secular Left to counterbalance the Religious Right. Secularism has introduced new tensions within the Democratic Party while adding oxygen to political polarization between Democrats and Republicans. Still there may be opportunities to reach common ground if politicians seek to forge coalitions that encompass both secular and religious Americans.},

  abstract = {Background: Many interventions find that social media engagement with health promotion materials can translate into behavioral changes. However, only a few studies have examined the ways in which specific actions on various social media platforms are correlated with health behaviors. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the association between social media use and HIV testing behaviors among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: In July 2016, a Web-based survey was conducted to recruit MSM in 8 Chinese cities through Blued (Blue City Holdings Ltd.), the world's largest gay mobile phone app. Data on sociodemographic variables, social media use platforms and behaviors, sexual behaviors, and HIV testing histories were collected. HIV testing\textendash related social media use was defined as having ever engaged with HIV testing content on social media, which was further divided into observing (ie, receiving), endorsing (eg, liking and sharing), and contributing (eg, posting or commenting on HIV testing materials). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to determine the best division of HIV testing\textendash related social media use. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to examine the association between HIV testing\textendash related social media use and HIV testing behaviors. Results: A total of 2105 individuals participated in the survey. Among them, 46.75\% (984) were under the age of 24 years, 35.43\% (746) had high school education or less, and 47.74\% (587) had condomless sex in the last 3 months. More than half of the respondents (58.14\%, 1224/2105) reported HIV testing\textendash related social media use. Additionally, HIV testing\textendash related social media use, especially on multifunctional platforms such as WeChat, was found to be associated with recent HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.32, 95\% CI 1.66-3.24). Contributing on social media was correlated with recent HIV testing (aOR 2.10, 95\% CI 1.40-3.16), but neither observing (aOR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.38-1.15) nor endorsing (aOR 1.29, 95\% CI 0.88-1.90) were correlated. Conclusions: Our data suggest that social media use, particularly on multifunctional platforms such as WeChat and with contributing behaviors, is correlated with HIV testing among MSM in China. Campaigns that promote active participant contribution on social media beyond passive observation and endorsement of promotional materials are needed. This study has implications for the design and implementation of social media interventions to promote HIV testing.},

  abstract = {Background The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) is a commonly used freely available self-report measure of depressive symptoms. Despite its popularity, several recent investigations have called into question the robustness and suitability of the commonly used 4-factor 20-item CES-D model. The goal of the current study was to address these concerns by confirming the factorial validity of the CES-D. Methods and Findings Differential item functioning estimates were used to examine sex biases in item responses, and confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess prior CES-D factor structures and new models heeding current theoretical and empirical considerations. Data used for the analyses included undergraduate (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}948; 74\% women), community (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}254; 71\% women), rehabilitation (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}522; 53\% women), clinical (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}84; 77\% women), and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2814; 56\% women) samples. Differential item functioning identified an item as inflating CES-D scores in women. Comprehensive comparison of the several models supported a novel, psychometrically robust, and unbiased 3-factor 14-item solution, with factors (i.e., negative affect, anhedonia, and somatic symptoms) that are more in line with current diagnostic criteria for depression. Conclusions Researchers and practitioners may benefit from using the novel factor structure of the CES-D and from being cautious in interpreting results from the originally proposed scale. Comprehensive results, implications, and future research directions are discussed.},

While there are many forms such an assessment can take, we view it as providing insight into who are the key actors, what are the key issues, sentiments, resources, activities and locations, how have these changed in recent times, and what roles do the various actors play. We propose a mixed initiative rapid ethnographic approach that supports socio-cultural assessment through a network analysis lens. We refer to this as the data-to-model (D2M) process. In D2M, semi-automated computer-based text-mining and machine learning techniques are used to extract networks linking people, groups, issues, sentiments, resources, activities and locations from vast quantities of texts. Human-in-the-loop procedures are then used to tune and correct the extracted data and refine the computational extraction. Computational post-processing is then used to refine the extracted data and augment it with other information, such as the latitude and longitude of particular cities. This methodology is described and key challenges illustrated using three distinct data sets. We find that the data-to-model approach provides a reusable, scalable, rapid approach for generating a rapid ethnographic assessment in which human effort and coding errors are reduced, and the resulting coding can be replicated.},

Methods: The SOSI was administered to 344 cancer patients registered for a stress-management program. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied using three criteria based on communality, factor loading, and desired subscale size. Scores on the revised C-SOSI were correlated with scores on measures of quality of life, mood disturbance, sleep, and spirituality to begin investigation of convergent and discriminant validity. Results: The EFA resulted in a 56-item scale (down from the original 94 items) with 8 subscales, each consisting of 6\textendash 9 items named: Depression, Anger, Muscle Tension, Cardiopulmonary Arousal, Sympathetic Arousal, Neurological/GI, Cognitive Disorganization, and Upper Respiratory Symptoms. Cronbach's alpha reliabilities for the subscales ranged from 0.80 to 0.95. Convergent and discriminant validity was supported by correlations with other measures as conceptually predicted. Conclusions: The C-SOSI is a reliable tool with converging validity for assessing stress symptoms in an oncology population. Further validation work is recommended to support use in other patient or community groups.},

In this research, we investigate the role of social norms associated with specific gender environments in the workplace in accounting for differences in health-reporting behaviours across men and women. Using the 2010 European Working Conditions Survey, we build a database containing 30,124 observations. We first replicate the standard result that women report worse health than men, whatever the health outcome we consider. We then proxy social norms by the gender structure of the workplace environment and study how the latter affects self-reported health for men and women separately. Our findings indicate that individuals in workplaces where women are a majority tend to report worse health than individuals employed in male-dominated work environments, be they men or women. These results are robust to controlling for a large array of working condition indicators, which allows us to rule out that the poorer health status reported by individuals working in femaledominated environments could be due to worse job quality. This evidence suggests that social norms associated with specific gender environments play an important role in explaining differences in healthreporting behaviours across gender, at least in the workplace.},

  author = {Carpenter, James R and Kenward, Michael G},
  pages = {206},
  abstract = {Objective: Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical trials, yet recent research suggests many statisticians and investigators appear uncertain how to handle them. The objective of this monograph is to set out a principled approach for handling missing data in clinical trials, and provide examples and code to facilitate its adoption. Data sources: An asthma trial from GlaxoSmithKline, a asthma trial from AstraZeneca, and a dental pain trial from GlaxoSmithKline. Methods: Part I gives a non-technical review of how missing data are typically handled in the analysis of clinical trials, and outlines the issues raised by missing data. When faced with missing data, we show no analysis can avoid making additional untestable assumptions. This leads to a proposal for a principled, systematic approach for handling missing data in clinical trials, which in turn informs a critique of current Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products guidelines for missing data, together with many of the ad-hoc statistical methods currently employed. Part II shows how primary analyses in a range of settings can be carried out under the so-called missing at random assumption. This key assumption has a central role in underpinning the most important classes of primary analysis, such as those based on likelihood. However its validity cannot be assessed from the data under analysis, so in Part III two main approaches are developed and illustrated, for the assessment of the sensitivity of the primary analyses to this assumption. Examples: Throughout, examples are used to illustrate the arguments and analyses. Code for the analyses (mostly in SAS) is given in Appendix C. The end of each example is indicated with a ` '. Results: The literature review revealed missing data are often ignored, or poorly handled in the analysis. Current guidelines, and frequently used ad-hoc statistical methods, are shown to be flawed. A principled, yet practical, alternative approach is developed, which examples show leads to inferences with greater validity. SAS code is given to facilitate its direct application. Conclusions: From the design stage onwards, a principled approach to handling missing data should be adopted. Such an approach follows well-defined and accepted statistical arguments, using models and assumptions that are transparent, and hence open to criticism and debate. This monograph outlines how this principled approach can be practically, and directly, applied to the majority of trials with longitudinal follow-up.},

A follow-up screening assessment of BP and antihypertensive medication status occurred 10 yrs later. Ss were 796 male public servants, aged 35\textendash 55 yrs at entry to the study. Systolic BP reactions to mental stress were positively correlated with follow-up screening systolic BP and, to a lesser extent, follow-up diastolic pressure. In multivariate tests, the strongest predictors of follow-up BPs were initial screening BPs. In the case of follow-up systolic BP, systolic reactions to stress emerged as an additional predictor of follow-up systolic BP. For diastolic BP, reactivity did not enter the analogous equations. The same outcomes emerged when the analyses were adjusted for medication status. When hypertension at 10-yr follow-up was the focus, both systolic and diastolic reactions to stress were predictive. However, with correction for age and initial screening BP, these associations were no longer significant. Results provide modest support for the hypothesis that heightened BP reactions to mental stress contribute to the development of high blood pressure.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This epidemiological study examined whether the magnitude of blood pressure reactions to mental stress was associated with future blood pressure and whether the strength of association was affected by sex, age, and socioeconomic position. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting blood pressure was recorded at initial baseline and in response to mental stress. Five-year follow-up resting blood pressure data were available for 990 (68\%) of the participants; 333 were 23 years old at the time of stress testing, 427 were 43, and 230 were 63. There were 541 women and 449 men; 440 came from manual and 550 from nonmanual occupation households. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure reactions to stress correlated positively with follow-up systolic blood pressure; no association was found for diastolic blood pressure reactions and follow-up diastolic blood pressure. In multivariate tests, systolic reactivity remained predictive of follow-up systolic blood pressure and accounted for 2.3\% of the variance not explained by age, body mass index, and initial baseline systolic blood pressure. Systolic and diastolic reactivity predicted 5-year upward drift in systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively, accounting for an additional 3.6\% and 2.9\% of variance, respectively, in multivariate models. The predictive value of reactivity was greater for participants from manual occupation households and tended to be greater for men. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that blood reactions to mental stress predict future blood pressure status and the increase in resting blood pressure over time. The magnitude of the prediction appears to vary with socioeconomic position and sex.},

Rates should be considered as observations in a Lexis diagram, and tabulation a necessary reduction of data, which should be as small as possible, and age, period and cohort should be treated as continuous variables.

This paper gives a guide to analysis of rates from a Lexis diagram by the age\textendash period\textendash cohort model. Three aspects are considered separately: (1) tabulation of cases and person-years; (2) modelling of age, period and cohort effects; and (3) parametrization and reporting of the estimated effects. It is argued that most of the confusion in the literature comes from failure to make a clear distinction between these three aspects.

Endorsement by church leadership is often necessary for the approval of programs and activities within churches; however, little is known about how church leaders perceive their respective churches as health promotion organizations. The purpose of this exploratory pilot was to report perceptions of church capacity to promote health among African American clergy leaders of predominantly African American rural churches. The analysis sample included 27 pastors of churches in Eastern NC who completed a survey on church health promotion capacity and perceived impact on their own health. Capacities assessed included perceived need and impact of health promotion activities, church preparedness to promote health, health promotion actions to take, and the existence and importance of health ministry attributes. The results from this pilot study indicated a perceived need to increase the capacity of their churches to promote health. Conducting health programs, displaying health information, collaborations within the church (i.e., kitchen committee working with the health ministry), partnerships outside of the church, and funding were most commonly reported needed capacities. Findings from this exploratory work lay the foundation for the development of future, larger observational studies that can specify some of the key factors associated with organizational change and ultimately health promotion in these rural church settings.},

Filling out this imagination is whiteness, nonwhiteness, and the negative anchor of the entire scheme, blackness. Beyond outlining this problem is the constructive task of reimagining Christian identity and theology beyond its tyrannical modern performance inside of whiteness.

A team-based approach to analyzing qualitative data increases confidence in dependability and trustworthiness, facilitates analysis of large data sets, and supports collaborative and participatory research by including diverse stakeholders in the analytic process. However, it can be difficult to reach consensus when coding with multiple coders. We report on one approach for creating consensus when open coding within an iterative-inductive analytical strategy. The strategy described may be used in a variety of settings to foster efficient and credible analysis of larger qualitative data sets, particularly useful in applied research settings where rapid results are often required.},

Results Prior to propensity score matching, Black clergy reported worse physical health than their White counterparts. They had greater body mass index, higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and lower physical health functioning. White clergy reported less favorable mental health. They had higher severity of depression and anxiety symptoms as well as lower quality of life and mental health functioning. Propensity score analysis revealed that matching on SES and other key variables accounted for most, but not all, of the observed racial differences. Racial disparities in hypertension, depression severity, and mental health functioning persisted despite adjustments. Conclusions Race contributed to health disparities in some outcomes in our study population, above and beyond our measures of participants' present SES and key demographic, occupational, and physical activity variables.

The aim of this paper was to investigate whether and how routine activities promote flourishing. The authors proposed that flourishers thrive because they capitalize on the processes featured in the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, specifically by experiencing greater positive emotional reactivity to pleasant events and building more resources over time. To test these hypotheses, the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) was administered to a prescreened community sample of adults (n = 208) and they were recontacted 2\textendash 3 months later. Results showed that relative to those who did not flourish or were depressed, people who flourish generally responded with bigger ``boosts'' in positive emotions in response to everyday, pleasant events (helping, interacting, playing, learning, spiritual activity) and this greater positive emotional reactivity, over time, predicted higher levels of two facets of the cognitive resource of mindfulness. In turn, these higher levels of mindfulness were positively associated with higher levels of flourishing at the end of study, controlling for initial levels of flourishing. These results suggest that the promotion of well-being may be fueled by small, yet consequential differences in individuals' emotional experience of pleasant everyday events. Additionally, these results underscore the utility of the broaden-and-build theory in understanding the processes by which flourishing is promoted, and provide support for a positive potentiation perspective.},

It is based on qualitative research taking two deprived areas as exemplary case studies, and involving depth interviews with residents. Neighbourhood influences on networks and social capital were explored, network typologies developed reflecting structural and cultural aspects of individual's networks, and pathways implicated in health effects considered. The complexity of social capital is addressed. The role of three factors in influencing social networks and social capital are demonstrated: neighbourhood characteristics and perceptions; poverty and social exclusion, and social consciousness. Perceptions of inequality could be a source of social capital as well as demoralisation. Different network structuresdense and weak, homogeneous and heterogeneous- were involved in the creation of social capital and had implications for well being. Coping, enjoyment of life and hope are identified as benefits. Although participation in organisations was confirmed as beneficial, it is suggested that today's heterogeneous neighbourhoods also require regenerated local work opportunities to develop bridging ties necessary for the genesis of inclusive social capital and better health. Despite the capacity of social capital to buffer its harsher effects, the concept is not wholly adequate for explaining the deleterious effects of poverty on health and well being. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Demonstrating the value of recent methodological advances, two studies conducted in two workplaces and two countries sought to answer the following questions: 1) Do coworkers interact more with coworkers who have similar well-being?; and, if yes, 2) what are the processes by which such affiliation occurs? Affiliation was assessed via two methodologies: a commonly used self-report measure (i.e., mutual nominations by coworkers) complemented by a behavioral measure (i.e., sociometric badges that track physical proximity and social interaction). We found that individuals who share similar levels of well-being (e.g., positive affect, life satisfaction, need satisfaction, and job satisfaction) were more likely to socialize with one another. Furthermore, time-lagged analyses suggested that clustering in need satisfaction arises from mutual attraction (homophily), whereas clustering in job satisfaction and organizational prosocial behavior results from emotional contagion.},

Burnout advances across three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced accomplishment. The debilitating effects of pastoral burnout were examined through a survey of 270 pastors. Relationships between burnout and three potentially preventative or mitigating factors, spiritual renewal, rest-taking, and support system practices, were explored. The results identified spiritual dryness as the primary predictor of emotional exhaustion, the stress dimension of burnout. In the published literature, no other work to date has empirically substantiated a link between pastors' spirituality and burnout.

RESEARCH DESIGN A N D METHODS \textemdash{} Based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, the World Health Organization criteria were used for the diagnosis of glucose intolerance in a population-based study involving 1,513 Chinese subjects in two work sites. Demographic data including age, family history of diabetes, BM1, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and sitting blood pressure (BP) were documented. Fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride (TG) and insulin concentrations, and spot urinary albumin concentration (Ualb) were also measured. Structural equation modeling incorporating factor analysis and path analysis was performed to examine the causal relationships among these variables and their interactions. RESULTS \textemdash{} Subjects who were treated with antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive drugs or who had a plasma creatinine level \^150 jamol/1 were excluded (n = 52). The prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were 3.9\% (n = 34) and 7.2\% (n = 63) in men (n = 881) and 3.1\% (n = 18) and 6.7\% (n = 39) in women (n = 580), respectively. In both groups, glucose intolerance was associated with increasing age, higher BMI, WHR, BP, Ualb, scrum TG, and insulin levels as well as higher prevalence rates of positive family history of diabetes. Structural equation modeling showed that age was a significant determinant for both BMI and WHR. Age and obesity accounted for most of the variance of BP, Ualb, plasma glucose, insulin and TG levels either directly or indirectly. Plasma glucose was determined by a positive family history of diabetes, age, and BMI while TG was dependent on BMI and WHR. Serum insulin was mainly determined by a positive family history of diabetes, obesity, plasma glucose, and TG levels. Apart from age and obesity, BP was also determined by serum insulin, both of which had causal effects on Ualb. CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} This model emphasizes the centrality of aging and obesity as well as a positive family history of diabetes as major determinants of the components of the metabolic syndrome. These components in turn had causal effects upon one another. Apart from a familial tendency, a central neurohormonal mechanism may account for these abnormalities mediated primarily through obesity and in close association with aging.},

  abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate whether women's adult overweight and obesity risk was associated with their childhood family structure, measured as their mothers' marital status history, during the women's first 18 years of life. Methods: Using linked register data, we analyzed 30,584 primiparous women born in Sweden in 1975 who were between 19\textendash 35 years of age when their height and pre-pregnancy weight was recorded. The outcomes were women's overweight/ obesity (body mass index (BMI) {$\geq$} 25 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI {$\geq$} 30 kg/m2) and the predictor was mothers' marital status history, which was summarized using sequence analysis. We carried out nested logistic regression models adjusting for women's age and maternal sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Mothers' marital status history was summarized into six clusters: stable marriage, stable cohabitation, married then divorcing, cohabiting then separating, varied transitions, and not with father. In fully adjusted models and compared with women whose mothers belonged to the stable marriage cluster: (1) women whose mothers belonged to the other marital status clusters had higher odds of overweight/obesity (odds ratio (OR) ranging 1.15\textendash 1.19; p {$<$} 0.05); and (2) women whose mothers belonged to the stable cohabitation (OR = 1.31; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14\textendash 1.52), cohabiting then separating (OR = 1.23; 95\% CI = 1.01\textendash 1.49), varied transitions (OR = 1.24; 95\% CI = 1.11\textendash 1.39), and not with father (OR = 1.24; 95\% CI = 1.00\textendash 1.54) clusters had higher odds of obesity. Conclusions: Women whose mothers were not in stable marriage relationships had higher odds of being overweight or obese in adulthood. The finding that even women raised in the context of stable cohabitation had higher odds of being overweight or obese is intriguing as these relationships are socially accepted in Sweden.},

As working long hours becomes increasingly common, a normative conception of gender that prioritizes men's careers over women's careers in dual-earner households may pressure women to quit their jobs. I apply multilevel models to longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to show that having a husband who works long hours significantly increases a woman's likelihood of quitting, whereas having a wife who works long hours does not appear to increase a man's likelihood of quitting. This gendered pattern is more prominent among workers in professional and managerial occupations, where the norm of overwork and the culture of intensive parenting are strong. Furthermore, the effect is stronger among workers who have children. Findings suggest that overwork can reintroduce the separate spheres arrangement, consisting of breadwinning men and homemaking women, to many formerly dual-earner households.},

This choice of a pragmatic rather than an explanatory approach to phase III clinical trial design has a number of consequences, some of which may be considered problematic.These include changes in what the trial is expected to accomplish, the way treatments are defined, the selection of subjects, the ways in which treatments are compared, and the assessment of the results. One also may end up challenging the real-world expectation that scientific results will be replicated before they are considered valid.This article discusses the connection between clinical equipoise and pragmatic trials, contrasts explanatory with pragmatic trials, points to the differences in the ways in which trial data are analyzed and interpreted, and discusses the power of replication, one of the defining hallmarks of the scientific method. Viewing clinical equipoise through a consequentialist lens reveals a number of problems, many of which are attributable to equipoise's insistence on a pragmatic approach to trial architecture.},

Much less analytic attention has centered on the origins of these racial disparities and, specifically, the mechanisms that may be playing a role. In this article, we argue that persistent gaps in college attendance warrant attention given their implications for broader patterns of racial stratification and its reproduction across generations. Using longitudinal data, we analyze disparities in family background and potentially influential investments parents make (or are constrained from making) early and late in the high school experience, and then how the patterns uncovered shape the likelihood of college attendance. Findings confirm expectations. Specifically, racial inequalities in class background shape disparities in cultural, monetary, and parental interactional investments, with strong consequences for high school attainment/achievement. Background inequalities, and their implications for early and later family investments and achievement/attainment, explain the entire black-white gap in the likelihood of college attendance. We conclude by discussing our argument and findings relative to educational research, race/class stratification theory, and existing perspectives on racial inequality and from where it emanates.},

This Handbook provides an unparalleled, critical guide to its principles and practice.  The volume is organized into three sections. The first systematically locates ethnography firmly in its relevant historical and intellectual contexts. The roots of ethnography are pinpointed and the pattern of its development is demonstrated.  The second section examines the contribution of ethnography to major fields of substantive research. The impact and strengths and weaknesses of ethnographic method are dealt with authoritatively and accessibly.  The third section moves on to examine key debates and issues in ethnography, from the conduct of research through to contemporary arguments.  The result is a landmark work in the field, which draws on the expertise of an internationally renowned group of interdisicplinary scholars. The Handbook of Ethnography provides readers with a one-stop critical guide to the past, present and future of ethnography. It will quickly establish itself as the ethnographer's bible.},

In this article, the authors examine consumption from a structural perspective and argue that black households face unique constraints restricting their ability to acquire important goods and services. Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys, the authors examine racial differences in total spending and in spending on major categories of goods and services (food, transportation, utilities, housing, health care, and entertainment). The authors also capture heterogeneous effects of racial stratification across class by modeling racial consumption gaps across household income levels. The results show that black households tend to have lower levels of total spending than their white counterparts and that these disparities tend to persist across income levels. Overall, these analyses indicate that racial disparities in consumption exist independently of other economic disparities and may be a key unexamined factor in the reproduction of racial inequality.},

Methods: Data from the Ontario Health Survey, a representative population sample (n = 9,953) of respondents aged 15 years and older, were analyzed using logistic regression. Adverse childhood experiences examined were childhood physical and sexual abuse, parental marital conflict, poor parent-child relationship, low parental education and parental psychopathology. Results: Most (72\%) respondents reported at least one adverse childhood experience and a considerable proportion of respondents (37\%) reported two or more of these experiences. In examining the bivariate models, childhood physical and sexual abuse had a stronger influence than other types of adverse childhood experiences. With the addition of other adverse childhood experiences in the model, the odds ratios for childhood abuse were attenuated but remained statistically significant for most health outcomes. This suggests that childhood abuse may have a unique adverse influence on the development of poor adult health. When an aggregate variable was created to explore the cumulative effects of adverse childhood experience, the odds were increased, with each additional experience, for reporting multiple health problems [odds ratio (OR): 1.22], poor self-rated health (OR: 1.18), pain (OR: 1.24), disability (OR: 1.24), general practitioner use (OR: 1.12), emergency room use (OR: 1.29) and health professional use (OR: 1.19). Conclusions: This study suggests that childhood abuse and other adverse childhood experiences are overlapping risk factors for long-term adult health problems and that the accumulation of these adverse experiences increases the risk of poor adult health.},

  abstract = {The concept of vacancy chains, originally developed in Harrison White's pioneering analysis of organizational mobility processes, has been extended to phenomena as diverse as national labor and housing markets, the historical development of professions, gender and ethnic group discrimination in job and housing markets, organizational demography, and the mobility of hermit crabs to empty snail shells. In all populations in which they occur\textemdash whether human or animal\textemdash vacancy chains appear to organize a variety of social processes in nearly identical ways. This chapter provides a broad and relatively nonmathematical review of the vacancy chain literature covering basic definitions and formulations, main theoretical ideas and assumptions, comparisons of social processes in different vacancy chain systems, and several conceptual and methodological extensions to vacancy chain analysis. The review concludes by discussing a number of outstanding problems, present limitations, and promising areas for future research using the vacancy chain approach to mobility.},

  abstract = {More Americans belong to religious congregations than to any other kind of voluntary association. What these vast numbers amount to--what people are doing in the over 300,000 churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples in the United States--is a question that resonates through every quarter of American society, particularly in these times of "faith-based initiatives," "moral majorities," and militant fundamentalism. And it is a question answered in depth and in detail in Congregations in America.  Drawing on the 1998 National Congregations Study--the first systematic study of its kind--as well as a broad range of quantitative, qualitative, and historical evidence, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the most significant form of collective religious expression in American society: local congregations. Among its more surprising findings, Congregations in America reveals that, despite the media focus on the political and social activities of religious groups, the arts are actually far more central to the workings of congregations. Here we see how, far from emphasizing the pursuit of charity or justice through social services or politics, congregations mainly traffic in ritual, knowledge, and beauty through the cultural activities of worship, religious education, and the arts.  Along with clarifying--and debunking--arguments on both sides of the debate over faith-based initiatives, the information presented here comprises a unique and invaluable resource, answering previously unanswerable questions about the size, nature, make-up, finances, activities, and proclivities of these organizations at the very center of American life.

Beyond Congregations  Appendix A: National Congregations Study Methodology Appendix B: Selected Summary Statistics from the National Congregations Study Notes References Index Reviews of this book: An unchurched observer might conclude that American congregational life centers on political or social service activities...[But] using his pioneering 1998 National Congregations Survey, the first study to delve into the specific activities of a truly representative sampling of the nation's religious congregations, [Chaves] finds that politics and service programs are not the main draws. Indeed, most congregations put little effort into community work...What congregations are most engaged in, Chaves reveals, are cultural activities. That includes education and the many components of worship, of course, but also the generally less-remarked-upon activities of producing and consuming art and culture, particularly musical and theatrical performances, outside of worship.--Jay Tolson, U.S. News and World Report},

This article uses data from the 2012 National Congregations Study to describe key features of congregational involvement in social service programs and projects. Most congregations (83\%), containing 92\% of religious service attendees, engage in some social or human service activities intended to help people outside of their congregation. These programs are primarily oriented to food, health, clothing, and housing provision, with less involvement in some of the more intense and long-term interventions such as drug abuse recovery, prison programs, or immigrant services. The median congregation involved in social services spent \$1500 per year directly on these programs, and 17\% had a staff member who worked on them at least a quarter of the time. Fewer than 2\% of congregations received any government financial support of their social service programs and projects within the past year; only 5\% had applied for such funding. The typical, and probably most important, way in which congregations pursue social service activity is by providing small groups of volunteers to engage in well-defined and bounded tasks on a periodic basis, most often in collaboration with other congregations and community organizations.},

  abstract = {Background Concerns about the occurrence of disease among household members generally initiate treatment-seeking actions. This study aims to identify the various treatment-seeking options of patients in Lubumbashi, analyze their health-seeking behaviour, identify determinants for the use of formal care, and analyze direct health care expenditure. Methods A cross-sectional survey of households in Lubumbashi was conducted in July 2010. Information was collected from a randomly selected sample of 251 households with at least one member who had been ill in the 2 weeks preceding the survey. Results Frequently used initial treatment-seeking options consist of self-medication based on modern medicines (54.6\%), the use of first-line health services (23.1\%) and hospitals (11.9\%), with a perceived effectiveness of 51\%, 83\% and 91\% respectively. If people go for a second option, then formal health care services are most often preferred. The majority (60\%) of patients' spontaneous itineraries reflect the expected functioning of a local health care system, with a patient flow characterised by the use of a first line health facility prior to the use of hospital-based services. Chronicity of the disease is the main determinant of seeking formal care. Analysis of care expenditure reveals that drugs are the only line of expenditure in the informal system and the main source of expenditure in the formal system; costs do not discriminate between first-line health services and hospitals, and the payment system is regressive since the poorest patients pay the same amounts as the richest. Conclusions This study points to the importance of self-medication as the first therapeutic option for the majority of patients in Lubumbashi, whatever the nature of the health problem. There is a lot of room to rationalise this practice. Although formal care is not common initial therapeutic option, it is the source of care most patients turn to, especially when they believe having a chronic disease. Patients' itineraries in this urban environment are complex; health managers should try and deal with this reality. Finally, our study indicates that poor patients face the same level of out-of-pocket payments as the more wealthy ones, hence the need for more equitable health care financing arrangements.},

  author = {Chen, Fang Fang},
  year = {2007},
  journal = {Structural Equation Modeling},
  pages = {464--504},
  abstract = {Two Monte Carlo studies were conducted to examine the sensitivity of goodness of fit indexes to lack of measurement invariance at 3 commonly tested levels: factor loadings, intercepts, and residual variances. Standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) appears to be more sensitive to lack of invariance in factor loadings than in intercepts or residual variances. Comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) appear to be equally sensitive to all 3 types of lack of invariance. The most intriguing finding is that changes in fit statistics are affected by the interaction between the pattern of invariance and the proportion of invariant items: when the pattern of lack of invariance is uniform, the relation is nonmonotonic, whereas when the pattern of lack of invariance is mixed, the relation is monotonic. Unequal sample sizes affect changes across all 3 levels of invariance: Changes are bigger when sample sizes are equal rather than when they are unequal. Cutoff points for testing invariance at different levels are recommended. Measurement invariance is a prerequisite for comparing different cultural, ethnic, gender, age, or experimental versus control groups. When groups are compared based on instruments that do not measure the same constructs, inference prob-lems occur. In other words, the conclusions drawn from a study may be biased or invalid if the measures that we rely on do not have the same meanings across different groups. Consequently, an effective health prevention program might be deemed harmful whereas a detrimental early education program might be considered beneficial. For example, in a pioneering study (Millsap \& Kwok, 2004) on the impact of lack of measurement invariance on group comparisons, selection bias under varying conditions of lack of invariance was examined.

We aim to investigate (1) the trend of HIV testing rates among Chinese MSM during 2009 to 2011; and (2) the patterns of multiple sexual relationships with male, female and commercial partners. Results: The self-reported past-12-months HIV testing level among Chinese MSM increased from 16.6\% in 2009 to 46.3\% in 2010 and 58.6\% in 2011 ({$\chi$}2 = 173.49, p {$<$} 0.001).

Furthermore, 21.3\% (56/263) MSM reported having multiple regular male and female sexual partnerships and 6.2\% (16/257) reported having commercial male partners in the past six months. However, individuals who were never-tested for HIV are consistently less likely to engage in multiple sexual relationships. Conclusions: HIV testing rates have increased substantially among Chinese MSM in the period 2009\textendash 2011, although significant barriers to testing remain. Multiple sexual partnerships, and especially bisexual behaviours, are common among Chinese MSM.},

We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. Methods We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The bodymass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors. N Engl J Med 2007;357:370-9. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society. Results Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], {$\geq$}30) were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased by 40\% (95\% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37\% (95\% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence on each other than those of the opposite sex. The spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network. Conclusions Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions.},

  abstract = {Group-level variance estimates of zero often arise when fitting multilevel or hierarchical linear models, especially when the number of groups is small. For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2, {$\lambda$}) penalty with {$\lambda$} \textrightarrow{} 0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior. Our default method provides better estimates of model parameters and standard errors than the maximum likelihood or the restricted maximum likelihood estimators. The log-gamma family can also be used to convey substantive prior information. In either case\textemdash pure penalization or prior information\textemdash our recommended procedure gives nondegenerate estimates and in the limit coincides with maximum likelihood as the number of groups increases.},

  abstract = {Background: The true causes of the obesity epidemic are not well understood and there are few longitudinal populationbased data published examining this issue. The objective of this analysis was to examine trends in occupational physical activity during the past 5 decades and explore how these trends relate to concurrent changes in body weight in the U.S. Methodology/Principal Findings: Analysis of energy expenditure for occupations in U.S. private industry since 1960 using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mean body weight was derived from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). In the early 1960's almost half the jobs in private industry in the U.S. required at least moderate intensity physical activity whereas now less than 20\% demand this level of energy expenditure. Since 1960 the estimated mean daily energy expenditure due to work related physical activity has dropped by more than 100 calories in both women and men. Energy balance model predicted weights based on change in occupation-related daily energy expenditure since 1960 for each NHANES examination period closely matched the actual change in weight for 40\textendash 50 year old men and women. For example from 1960\textendash 62 to 2003\textendash 06 we estimated that the occupation-related daily energy expenditure decreased by 142 calories in men. Given a baseline weight of 76.9 kg in 1960\textendash 02, we estimated that a 142 calories reduction would result in an increase in mean weight to 89.7 kg, which closely matched the mean NHANES weight of 91.8 kg in 2003\textendash 06. The results were similar for women. Conclusion: Over the last 50 years in the U.S. we estimate that daily occupation-related energy expenditure has decreased by more than 100 calories, and this reduction in energy expenditure accounts for a significant portion of the increase in mean U.S. body weights for women and men.},

In this study, we use data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, together with regression-based analytical techniques, to identify the primary sources of the BA completion gap. We find that black students' lower academic and socioeconomic resources are the biggest drivers of the gap. However, we also find that black students are more likely to enroll in four-year colleges than are white students, given pre-college resources. We describe this dynamic as ``paradoxical persistence'' because it challenges Boudon's well-known assertion that the secondary effect of educational decision-making should reinforce the primary effect of resource discrepancies. Instead, our results indicate that black students' paradoxical persistence widens the race gap in BA completion while also narrowing the race gap in BA attainment, or the proportion of high school graduates to receive a BA. This narrowing effect on the BA attainment gap is as large or larger than the narrowing effect of black students' ``overmatch'' to high-quality colleges, facilitated in part by affirmative action. Paradoxical persistence refocuses attention on black students' individual agency as an important source of existing educational gains.},

Existing estimates however are of varying and perhaps poor quality because many countries do not collect official data on religious identity. We propose a method for accurately measuring religious group demographics using existing survey data: Bayesian multilevel regression models with poststratification. We illustrate this method by estimating the demography of Muslims, Hindus, and Jews in Great Britain over a 20-year period and validate it by comparing our estimates to UK census data on religious demography. Our estimates are very accurate, differing from true population proportions by as little as 0.29 (Muslim) to 0.04 (Jewish) percentage points. These findings have implications for the measurement of religious demography as well as small group attributes more generally.},

In this case, researchers should ask whether the coefficients associated with a given set of predictors change in a significant way when other predictors or covariates are added as controls. Simple calculations based on quantities provided by routines for regression analysis can be used to obtain the standard errors and other statistics that are required. Results are also given for the class of generalized linear models (e.g., logistic regression, log-linear models, etc.).

Having a small social support network is associated with social isolation and an increased risk of physical and emotional vulnerability. However, this conceptualization ignores the contributions of a host of other factors, including life experiences, family dynamics, and long-term patterns of socialization. This paper argues that alongside quantitative assessments of support systems, the application of a life course perspective is needed to understand small social networks as lived experience. We report on findings from 28 in-depth interviews with older adults identified as being at risk of social isolation on the basis of the self-reported size of their social networks. We discuss these participants' experiences in the context of significant life course transitions such as marriage and widowhood.},

Bridging groups are often expected to have greater effects on democratic norm development and to generate more positive externalities on society than bonding networks. To allow application of these theoretical constructs in practice, however, an adequate measurement of bridging versus bonding networks is crucial. One approach builds on connections between voluntary associations through individuals with multiple memberships. However, simply counting the number of members' additional memberships in other associations, as in previous work, is inappropriate. Indeed, we illustrate that this is biased towards finding that large associations are more bonding.We then propose a technique to alleviate this bias and illustrate that the proposed correction is crucial to avoid erroneous conclusions in tests of the hypothesis that membership in bridging or bonding associations is differently related to individuals' civic attitudes.},

Design Statistical analysis common in network studies, such as logistic regression analysis, controlled for own and friend's lagged health status. Analyses controlled for environmental confounders. Setting Subsamples of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Participants 4300 to 5400 male and female adolescents who nominated a friend in the dataset and who were both longitudinally surveyed. Measurements Health outcomes, including headache severity, acne severity, and height self reported by respondents in 1994-5, 1995-6, and 2000-1. Results Significant network effects were observed in the acquisition of acne, headaches, and height. A friend's acne problems increased an individual's odds of acne problems (odds ratio 1.62, 95\% confidence interval 0.91 to 2.89). The likelihood that an individual had headaches also increased with the presence of a friend with headaches (1.47, 0.93 to 2.33); and an individual's height increased by 20\% of his or her friend's height (0.18, 0.15 to 0.26). Each of these results was estimated by using standard methods found in several publications. After adjustment for environmental confounders, however, the results become uniformly smaller and insignificant. Conclusions Researchers should be cautious in attributing correlations in health outcomes of close friends to social network effects, especially when environmental confounders are not adequately controlled for in the analysis.},

The present study analyzed genome-wide transcriptional activity in people who chronically experienced high versus low levels of subjective social isolation (loneliness) to assess alterations in the activity of transcription control pathways that might contribute to increased adverse health outcomes in social isolates. Results: DNA microarray analysis identified 209 genes that were differentially expressed in circulating leukocytes from 14 high- versus low-lonely individuals, including up-regulation of genes involved in immune activation, transcription control, and cell proliferation, and down-regulation of genes supporting mature B lymphocyte function and type I interferon response. Promoter-based bioinformatic analyses showed under-expression of genes bearing anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid response elements (GREs; p = 0.032) and over-expression of genes bearing response elements for pro-inflammatory NF-{$\kappa$}B/Rel transcription factors (p = 0.011). This reciprocal shift in pro- and antiinflammatory signaling was not attributable to differences in circulating cortisol levels, or to other demographic, psychological, or medical characteristics. Additional transcription control pathways showing differential activity in bioinformatic analyses included the CREB/ATF, JAK/STAT, IRF1, C/ EBP, Oct, and GATA pathways. Conclusion: These data provide the first indication that human genome-wide transcriptional activity is altered in association with a social epidemiological risk factor. Impaired transcription of glucocorticoid response genes and increased activity of pro-inflammatory transcription control pathways provide a functional genomic explanation for elevated risk of inflammatory disease in individuals who experience chronically high levels of subjective social isolation.},

Graduating from cross-sectional to longitudinal designs enables researchers to make more rigorous inferences about the causal relations implied by such models. In this transition, misconceptions and erroneous assumptions are the norm. First, we describe some of the questions that arise (and misconceptions that sometimes emerge) in longitudinal tests of mediational models. We also provide a collection of tips for structural equation modeling (SEM) of mediational processes. Finally, we suggest a series of 5 steps when using SEM to test mediational processes in longitudinal designs: testing the measurement model, testing for added components, testing for omitted paths, testing the stationarity assumption, and estimating the mediational effects.},

  abstract = {The concept of intersectionality has become a central topic in academic and activist circles alike. But what exactly does it mean, and why has it emerged as such a vital lens through which to explore how social inequalities of race, class, gender, sexuality, age, ability, and ethnicity shape one another?  In this fully revised and expanded second edition of their popular text, Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge provide a much-needed introduction to the field of intersectional knowledge and praxis. Analyzing the emergence, growth, and contours of the concept of intersectionality, the authors also consider its global reach through an array of new topics such as the rise of far-right populism, reproductive justice, climate change, and digital environments and cultures. Accessibly written and drawing on a plethora of lively examples to illustrate its arguments, the book highlights intersectionality's potential for understanding complex architecture of social and economic inequalities and bringing about social justice-oriented change. Intersectionality will be an invaluable resource for anyone grappling with the main ideas, debates, and new directions in this field.},

The review begins with an introduction to posttraumatic stress disorder as being one of the possible negative consequences of exposure to traumatic events. The report proceeds with examining the concepts of vicarious traumatization, secondary traumatic stress, traumatic countertransference, burnout and compassion fatigue, as potential adverse consequences for workers who strive to help people who are traumatized. The differences between these concepts are also discussed. The notion of compassion satisfaction is examined as findings have demonstrated that it is a protective factor which can be used as a buffer to prevent the aforementioned concepts. Conversely, findings have shown that a history of previous stressful life events in helpers is a potential risk factor. The review concludes with an overview of the concepts considered, but cautions against generalization of the findings owing to the dearth of longitudinal studies into the issues raised and also the lack of investigation into the many different types of trauma.},

Refugees, on average, have less English language ability, less educational experience, different forms of family support, poorer mental and physical health, and generally reside in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods than other immigrants. Although these factors are well supported by evidence for specific refugee groups, a lack of representative data for both refugee and non-refugee migrants has made the testing of this refugee gap challenging. Using the first wave of the New Immigrant Survey, these hypotheses are tested on employment, occupation, and earnings outcomes using multivariate modelling techniques among recent immigrants in the United States. Findings demonstrate that accounting for each of the aforementioned explanatory factors minimizes the earnings and occupational differences between refugees and all other immigrants. Despite the inclusion of these factors within the model, however, a refugee disparity in earnings and occupational attainment continues to exist.},

Lutherville, MD: Sidran Press]. An additional goal was to test the relationship of these three constructs to each other. Method: A self-report instrument developed by Stamm and Figley was used to measure the risk of compassion fatigue and burnout and the potential for compassion satisfaction among 363 child protection staff participating in a secondary trauma training seminar. Results: Participants were significantly more likely to have high risk of compassion fatigue, extremely low risk of burnout, and good potential for compassion satisfaction. Participants with high compassion satisfaction had lower levels of compassion fatigue (p = .000; mean = 35.73 high compassion satisfaction group, mean = 43.56 low group) and lower levels of burnout (p = .000; mean = 32.99 high compassion satisfaction group, mean = 41.69 low group). Conclusion: Approximately 50\% of Colorado county child protection staff suffered from ``high'' or ``very high'' levels of compassion fatigue. The risk of burnout was considerably lower. More than 70\% of staff expressed a ``high''},

  year = {2022},

  abstract = {"When most people think of the history of modern conservatism, they think of Ronald Reagan, with his politics and policies front and center. Yet this narrow view of a movement obscures the whole, leaving many to question: How did Donald Trump win the presidency? And what is the future of the Republican party? In The Right, distinguished journalist Matthew Continetti shifts this lens, arguing that an understanding of the history of the pre-Reagan right is crucial to understanding the past and determining the future of the movement. The Right is a sweeping historical account of American conservatism's evolution, from the beginning of the Progressive Era through the present. It tells the story of how conservatism in the United States began as networks of intellectuals, often acting in concert with political figures, developed a critique of Progressivism and of New Deal liberalism, and institutionalized this vision in magazines, think tanks, nonprofits, and political entities and campaigns. Over time, these thinkers attracted new adherents, including former Democrats and evangelical Christians, and built up a conservative superstructure of organizations and media outlets that turned ideas into policy. With the end of the Cold War, this conservative superstructure found itself under attack from dissidents for whom it was too globalist, too corporate, and too open to unrestricted immigration. The superstructure held for two decades but buckled under the pressures of the second Iraq War and the global financial crisis of 2008. Just as the Vietnam War ended the reign of Cold War liberals in the Democratic Party, the Iraq War ended the reign of post-Cold War conservatives in the Republican Party, and the right began to resemble other national populist movements around the world. Drawing out the tensions between conservatism and populism, and between the conservative desire for mainstream acceptance and the pull of extremism, Continetti argues that the more one studies conservatism's past, the more one becomes convinced of its future. Deeply researched and brilliantly told, The Right is essential reading for anyone looking to understand the American right"--},

Drawing upon two conceptual tools arising from science and technology studies (STS), those of a ``classification system'' and ``the black box,'' this paper looks critically at discursive constructions of help-seeking in Africa within mental health research over the last decade. Research in this area can be divided into two dominant traditions: the knowledge-belief-practice survey and indigenous-knowledge-system approaches. Although the content and value-codes between these approaches differ, structurally they are very similar. Both are mediated by the same kind of system of classification, which demarcates the world into homogenous entities and binary oppositions. This system of ordering is one of the most stubborn and powerful forms of classification buried in the ``black box'' of the modernist/colonial knowledge archive and is fraught with many questionable Eurocentric epistemological assumptions. I consider whether there might be other ways of understanding help-seeking for mental illness in Africa and discuss two studies that illustrate such alternative approaches. In conclusion, I discuss some of the challenges this alternative kind of research faces in gaining more influence within contemporary global mental health discourse and practice.},

Conceived as a regression problem, the method is applicable to non-equidistant data, a major advantage. Another dividend is the feasibility of deriving confidence intervals for parameters of rhythmic components of known periods, readily drawn from the least squares procedure, stressing the importance of prior (external) information. Originally developed for the analysis of short and sparse data series, the extended cosinor has been further developed for the analysis of long time series, focusing both on rhythm detection and parameter estimation. Attention is given to the assumptions underlying the use of the cosinor and ways to determine whether they are satisfied. In particular, ways of dealing with non-stationary data are presented. Examples illustrate the use of the different cosinor-based methods, extending their application from the study of circadian rhythms to the mapping of broad time structures (chronomes).},

  abstract = {Trait stability and maturation are fundamental principles of contemporary personality psychology and have been shown to hold across many cultures. However, it has proven difficult to move beyond these general findings to a detailed account of trait development. There are pervasive and unexplained inconsistencies across studies that may be due to (a) insufficient attention to measurement error, (b) subtle but age-sensitive differences in alternative measures of the same trait, or (c) different perspectives reflected in self-reports and observer ratings. Multiscale, multimethod\textemdash and ideally multinational\textemdash studies are needed. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for trait stability and change, but supporting evidence is currently weak or indirect; trait development is a fertile if sometimes frustrating field for theory and research. Beyond traits, there are approaches to personality development that are of interest to students of adult development, and these may be fruitfully addressed from a trait perspective.},

In Study 3, the scale, along with other symptom-related measures and an existing measure of depressive ERS, was administered to an undergraduate sample at two different time points, one month apart. Greater ERS was associated with greater symptoms of social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive\textendash compulsive disorder (OCD), even after controlling for trait anxiety, depression, and intolerance of uncertainty. Among OCD symptoms, only thoughts of harm were uniquely related to ERS, a finding consistent with emerging literature. ERS involving general threats also predicted changes in social anxiety and GAD symptoms one month later. Overall, the findings implicate an important role for ERS across anxiety disorders.},

Research utilizing church membership and adherent count data has described spatial patterns of group affiliation since the 1950s and identified distinct regional patterns that have remained fairly stable over time. The population of religious adherents is a subset of the general population. High levels of population mobility in recent decades, particularly Sunbelt and Latin American in-migration, suggest the potential for shifts in geographic patterns of religious adherents. This paper uses recently released data and centrographic methods to analyze patterns of stability and change for a set of major U.S. Christian groups for 1980-2000. Quantitative analyses of enumeration counts, weighted mean centers, and standard deviational ellipses reveal different patterns of change among groups. Relative levels of change vary depending on the use of raw or normalized measures. Catholics, Mormons, and Seventh-Day Adventists were among the most dynamic groups with Southern Baptists being the most stable. Continuation of recent trends can potentially impact established culture regions and issues of regional identity and perceptions.},

Does the pastoral tenure depend on whether the minister serves as the senior pastor or associate pastor? An analysis will be done for each of these questions. The results will show that there are regional variations, size effects, and community type influences on pastoral tenure in the local church. Surprisingly, the interaction of these effects with the role of the pastors is more interesting than any single factor alone.},

However, some of the relevant empirical research has relied on rather conventional conceptions of space and place and focused on isolating the ``independent'' contribution of place-level and individual-level factors. This approach may have resulted in an underestimate of the contribution of `place' to disease risk. In this paper we argue the case for extensive (quantitative) as well as intensive (qualitative) empirical, as well as theoretical, research on health variation that incorporates `relational', views of space and place. Specifically, we argue that research in place and health should avoid the false dualism of context and composition by recognising that there is a mutually reinforcing and reciprocal relationship between people and place. We explore in the discussion how these theoretical perspectives are beginning to influence empirical research. We argue that these approaches to understanding how place relates to health are important in order to deliver effective, `contextually sensitive' policy interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most prevalent long-term psychiatric disorders among survivors of traumatic events. It is well established that social support has been related to the onset of PTSD after natural disasters. However, very little is known whether or not social support has had an influence on the recovery from the PTSD that was diagnosed after floods. This study, therefore, made a follow-up assessment of PTSD in flood victims 13\textendash 14 years after they were diagnosed with PTSD in 2000 to measure the prevalence rate of PTSD among them and identify the association between social support and their recovery from PTSD. Methods: Victims who had experienced Dongting Lake flood in 1998 and had been diagnosed as having PTSD in 2000 were enrolled in this study. A follow-up survey was done between the years 2013 and 2014 to diagnose the victims again of PTSD using the DSM-IV criteria. Social support and its three dimensions were measured using the Chinese version of Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), including objective support, subjective support and support utilization. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between social support and the recovery from PTSD after flood. Results: Out of 321 subjects with prior PTSD, 51 (15.89 \%) were diagnosed as still having PTSD. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the recovery from prior PTSD was significantly associated with social support (odds ratio (OR) =0.202, 95 \% confidence interval (95 \% CI): 0.047\textendash 0.878), subjective support (OR = 0.236, 95 \% CI: 0.080\textendash 0.694) and support utilization (OR = 0.245, 95 \% CI: 0.071\textendash 0.844). Conclusions: The prevalence rate of current PTSD indicates that natural disasters, such as floods, may affect the mental health of victims for a long time. Social support was significantly associated with the recovery from prior PTSD, especially subjective support and support utilization.},

Yet few studies have examined the role of traditional healers in meeting families' and communities' health needs and liaising with the formal health system. We examine these issues in Tshopo Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country with high rates of child mortality (104 deaths per 1000 live births). We conducted 127 in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussions with a range of community members (mothers, fathers and grandmothers of children under 5 years of age) and health providers (CHWs, traditional healers, doctors and nurses) on topics related to care seeking and case management for childhood illness and malnutrition, and analysed them iteratively using thematic content analysis. We find significant divergence between biomedical descriptions of child illness and concepts held by community members, who distinguished between local illnesses and so-called `white man's diseases.' Traditional healers were far less costly and more geographically accessible to families than were biomedical health providers, and usually served as families' first recourse after home care. Services provided by traditional healers were also more comprehensive than services provided by CHWs, as the traditional medicine sphere recognised and encompassed care for `modern' diseases (but not vice versa). Meanwhile, CHWs did not receive adequate training, supervision or supplies to provide child health services. Considering their accessibility, acceptability, affordability and ability to recognise all domains of illness (biomedical and spiritual), traditional healers can be seen as the de facto CHWs in Tshopo Province. National and international health policymakers should account for and involve this cadre of health workers when planning child health services and seeking to implement policies and programmes that genuinely engage with community health systems.},

  abstract = {Racism and discrimination have choked economic opportunity for African Americans at nearly every turn. At several historic moments, the trajectory of racial inequality could have been altered dramatically. Perhaps no moment was more opportune than the early days of Reconstruction, when the U.S. government temporarily implemented a major redistribution of land from former slaveholders to the newly emancipated enslaved. But neither Reconstruction nor the New Deal nor the civil rights struggle led to an economically just and fair nation. Today, systematic inequality persists in the form of housing discrimination, unequal education, police brutality, mass incarceration, employment discrimination, and massive wealth and opportunity gaps. Economic data indicates that for every dollar the average white household holds in wealth the average black household possesses a mere ten cents. In From Here to Equality, William Darity Jr. and A. Kirsten Mullen confront these injustices head-on and make the most comprehensive case to date for economic reparations for U.S. descendants of slavery. After opening the book with a stark assessment of the intergenerational effects of white supremacy on black economic well-being, Darity and Mullen look to both the past and the present to measure the inequalities borne of slavery. Using innovative methods that link monetary values to historical wrongs, they next assess the literal and figurative costs of justice denied in the 155 years since the end of the Civil War. Finally, Darity and Mullen offer a detailed roadmap for an effective reparations program, including a substantial payment to each documented U.S. black descendant of slavery. Taken individually, any one of the three eras of injustice outlined by Darity and Mullen--slavery, Jim Crow, and modern-day discrimination--makes a powerful case for black reparations. Taken collectively, they are impossible to ignore.},

Various scales related to Family Stress Theory and the ABC-X model were used in this investigation. Whereas clergy spouses had greater psychological and physiological stress than clergy, clergy had a greater sense of coherence and spiritual resources. Clergy spouses, however had a greater level of coping. Findings indicated that for both clergy and clergy spouses spiritual resources had the greatest total effect on their quality of life.

Method To explore this relationship, I analyze data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) Time-Series surveys and the Youth-Parent Socialization (YPS) panel study. Results I find that a matrix of belief, belonging, and behavior constrains the convergence between citizens' political identities, with one important caveat: evangelical affiliation functions as the primary conduit through which religiosity shapes this sorting. Building on these results, I then estimate the direct impact of religion on sorting over time. Conclusion These findings show that religion has produced asymmetric sorting in the mass public among persons with right-leaning identities. Further, they provide a social explanation for partisan-ideological sorting that complements extant institutional ones.},

ANSWER: Interesting theories are those which deny certain assumptions of their audience, while noninteresting theories are those which arm certain assumptions of their audience. This answer was arrived at through the examination of a number of famous social, and especially sociological, theories. That examination also generated a systematic index of the variety of propositional forms which interesting and non-interesting theories may take. The fertility of this approach suggested a new field be established called the Sociology of the Interesting, which is intended to supplement the Sociology of Knowledge. This new field will be phenomenologically oriented in so far as it will focus on the movement of the audience's mind from one accepted theory to another. It will be sociologically oriented in so far as it will focus on the dissimilar base-line theories of the various sociological categories which compose the audience. In addition to its value in interpreting the social impact of theories, the Sociology of the Interesting can contribute to our understanding of both the common sense and scientific perspectives on reality.},

  abstract = {Metrics of heart period variability are widely used in the behavioral and biomedical sciences, although somewhat confusingly labeled as heart rate variability (HRV). Despite their wide use, HRV metrics are usually analyzed and interpreted without reference to prevailing levels of cardiac chronotropic state (i.e., mean heart rate or mean heart period). This isolated treatment of HRV metrics is nontrivial. All HRV metrics routinely used in the literature exhibit a known and positive relationship with the mean duration of the interval between two beats (heart period): as the heart period increases, so does its variability. This raises the question of whether HRV metrics should be "corrected" for the mean heart period (or its inverse, the heart rate). Here, we outline biological, quantitative, and interpretive issues engendered by this question. We provide arguments that HRV is neither uniformly nor simply a surrogate for heart period. We also identify knowledge gaps that remain to be satisfactorily addressed with respect to assumptions underlying existing HRV correction approaches. In doing so, we aim to stimulate further progress toward the rigorous use and disciplined interpretation of HRV. We close with provisional guidance on HRV reporting that acknowledges the complex interplay between the mean and variability of the heart period.},

First, it is demonstrated that of the two only moral traditionalism relates to religious orthodoxy. Second, the well-established strong correlation between both value orientations proves to be caused, in the case at hand solely by the circumstance that nontraditionalism and nonauthoritarianism go hand in hand; moral traditionalism and authoritarianism are almost unrelated. Third, moral traditionalists are shown to vote for Christian right-wing parties, whereas authoritarianism more commonly leads to a vote for a secular right-wing party. Fourth, whereas moral traditionalism proves decisive for the voting behavior of Christians, it is authoritarianism that underlies the non-Christian vote. These findings from The Netherlands (consistent with theories on cultural modernization) lead to the conclusion that attention should be paid to the distinction between these orientations because this aids the interpretation of research findings, and because authoritarianism will probably gain a more central role in politics at the cost of moral traditionalism.},

In the last two decades, a shift has occurred in the way survey data are collected; telephone surveys and to a lesser degree mail surveys are now more extensively used. This has stimulated empirical research on the influence of the data collection method on data quality. A review of the empirical literature suggest small differences between mail surveys on the one hand and interview surveys (both telephone and face to face on the other. A controlled field experiment in the Netherlands confirms these results. It is somewhat harder to have people answer questions in a mail survey as indicated by a higher percentage of item missing data. but when questions were answered the data quality is better, as indicated by more self-disclosure on sensitive topics and more consistent answers. No data collection method was superior on all criteria. Furthermore, two substantive structural equation models (one on loneliness and one on general wellbeing) were compared across the three data collection methods. The different data collection methods turned out to produce significantly different covariance matrices. Subsequent analyses showed that structural models also differed: the same structure was found in each case, but the relative importance of some estimated parameters varied considerably across data collection methods.

The sample (n = 82) included students from two at-risk urban middle schools. Utilizing two measures, the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (CASSS; C. K. Malecki, M. K. Demaray, \& S. N. Elliott, 2000) and the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Self Report of Personality (BASC; C. R. Reynolds \& R. W. Kamphaus, 1998), data were collected at three time points. Results point to a relationship between social support and student adjustment behaviors over time. Specifically, support from parents was related to clinical maladjustment and emotional symptoms one year later. In fact, parent support was still related to clinical maladjustment one year later even after students' earlier levels of clinical maladjustment were taken into account. Parent support was also related to personal adjustment in the short term (6 months). Classmate support was related to students' emotional symptoms one year later. Finally, school support was related to school maladjustment one year later even after students' earlier school maladjustment was taken into account. Implications for school psychologists are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Psychol Schs 42: 691\textendash 706, 2005.},

  abstract = {Gender-based inequalities in health have been frequently documented. This paper examines the extent to which these inequalities reflect the different social experiences and conditions of men's and women's lives. We address four specific questions. Are there gender differences in mental and physical health? What is the relative importance of the structural, behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health? Are the gender differences in health attributable to the differing structural (socio-economic, age, social support, family arrangement) context in which women and men live, and to their differential exposure to lifestyle (smoking, drinking, exercise, diet) and psychosocial (critical life events, stress, psychological resources) factors? Are gender differences in health also attributable to gender differences in vulnerability to these structural, behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health? Multivariate analyses of Canadian National Population Health Survey data show gender differences in health (measured by self-rated health, functional health, chronic illness and distress). Social structural and psychosocial determinants of health are generally more important for women and behavioural determinants are generally more important for men. Gender differences in exposure to these forces contribute to inequalities in health between men and women, however, statistically significant inequalities remain after controlling for exposure. Gender-based health inequalities are further explained by differential vulnerabilities to social forces between men and women. Our findings suggest the value of models that include a wide range of health and health-determinant variables, and affirm the importance of looking more closely at gender differences in health.},

In a sample of 725 cohort members, an extensive psychological stress protocol was performed during which cardiovascular and cortisol responses were measured. In line with many previous studies, results showed that increased blood pressure responsiveness to the stress protocol was associated with an increased risk for hypertension 5years later. However, decreased cardiovascular and/or cortisol stress reactivity were associated with obesity and the risk of becoming obese, symptoms of depression and anxiety, a poor self-reported health, poor lung function, and poor cognitive function (all p for statistical tests{$<$}0.05). These associations generally survived adjustment for a range of potential confounders, including resting cardiovascular and cortisol activity, commitment to the stress tasks, sex, age, smoking and use of medication. Results from these studies agree with recent evidence that low biological reactivity to acute psychological stress may not always be beneficial for health but instead seems to be a marker for a range of negative health outcomes. Future studies have to point out whether low stress reactivity precedes or follows these negative health outcomes.},

There was no evidence of an intervention impact on BP or physical activity minutes per week.Conclusion: Implementing a multilevel intervention across diverse congregations resulted in small improvements in obesity outcomes. A longer time line is needed to fully implement and assess effects of community and congregation environmental strategies and to allow for potential larger impacts of the intervention.

The cases included 14 congregations in Los Angeles County representing diverse faith traditions and races-ethnicities. Activities fell into three broad categories: (1) prevention and education; (2) care and support; and (3) awareness and advocacy. Congregations that engaged early in the epidemic focused on care and support while those that became involved later focused on prevention and education. Most congregations interacted with external organizations or individuals to conduct their HIV activities, but promoting abstinence and teaching about condoms were conducted without external involvement. Opportunities exist for congregations to help address a variety of HIV-related needs. However, activities that are mission-congruent, such as providing pastoral care for people with HIV, raising HIV awareness, and promoting HIV testing, appear easier for congregations to undertake than activities aimed at harm reduction.},

Relevant issues are to what extent gender differences in charitable giving exist in another national context and how these differences can be explained. In this study, we examine female and male giving in the Netherlands, using a representative sample of Dutch households (N = 1,692) from the 2010 wave of the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Survey (GINPS). We conduct bivariate and multivariate regression analyses to test for gender differences and the extent to which they are mediated by values, costs, solicitation, and social pressure. Females turn out to be more likely to give and to give to more different sectors, which can be attributed to their higher prosocial values of empathic concern and the principle of care. Contrary to recent findings in the United States, Dutch males donate higher amounts than Dutch females.},

Mark DeYmaz, pastor of one of the most proven multi-ethnic churches in the country, writes from both his experience and his extensive study of how to plant, grow, and encourage more ethnically diverse churches. He argues that the \&quot;homogenous unit principle\&quot; will soon become irrelevant and that the most effective way to spread the gospel in an increasingly diverse world is through strong and vital multi-ethnic churches.Apart from ethnically and economically diverse relationships, we cannot understand others different from ourselves, develop trust for others who are different than us, and/or love others different than ourselves. Apart from understanding, trust, and love, we are less likely to get involved in the plight of others different than ourselves. Without involvement, nothing changes, and the disparaging consequences of systemic racism remain entrenched in our culture.Surely, it breaks the heart of God to see so many churches segregated ethnically or economically from one another, and that little has changed in the many years since it was first observed that eleven o\&\#39;clock on Sunday morning is the most segregated hour in the land.},

The idea came from the realization that there had been no attempt to bring together the various literatures on the topic. Discrimination and issues of employment diversity are significant topics today in IO psychology, business, and human resource management. This edited volume examines the following components of this important discussion:  how to explain discrimination in organizations; understanding discrimination against specific groups; and implications for practical efforts to reduce discrimination. This book brings together, in one volume, a review of the research on discrimination based on race, age, sexual orientation, gender, physical appearance, disability, and personality. In addition, it explores the multilevel antecedents and potential bases for a general model of discrimination in the workplace. While social psychological research and theory have provided invaluable insights, an understanding of discrimination in the workplace and solutions will require incorporating factors at the organizational level in addition to factors at the individual and group levels. Although a definitive model is not reached, the aim of this text is to facilitate future research and theory.},

Our three-level model permits the effects of macrolevel variables to be a function of a simple "buffering variable" that measures the sensitivity of different population groups to change. We develop a mixed estimator that allows for both types of methodological complications, and we use it to describe and explain recent trends in the process of stratification. The results yield new insights into the structure of short-term trends in the mobility regime.},

We organize the review in terms of three dimensions of the relationships among groups: power, status, and numbers (or composition).

Institutional theory suggests that external pressure for innovation reinforces internal advocacy. We argue that external pressure and internal advocacy serve as alternatives, such that when external pressure is already high, increases in internal advocacy will not alter the likelihood of program adoption. Moreover, institutional theory points to functional need as a driver of innovation. We argue that in the case of innovations designed to achieve new societal goals, functional need, as defined in this case by the absence of workforce diversity or the presence of regulatory oversight, is less important than corporate culture. Our findings help explain the spotty coverage of diversity programs. Firms that lack workforce diversity are no more likely than others to adopt programs, but firms with large contingents of women managers are more likely to do so. Pro-diversity industry and corporate cultures promote diversity programs. The findings carry implications for public policy.},

COVID's impact was inequitable: Deaths were concentrated among the elderly and minorities working in essential jobs, groups who up to the pandemic had been reporting better mental health. Yet how the shock has affected society's well-being and mental health is not fully understood. Exploring the impact by comparing 2019 to 2020 as reflected in nationally representative data sets, we found a variety of contrasting stories. While data from the 2019 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS) show that depression and anxiety increased significantly, especially among young and low-income Americans in 2020, we found no such changes when analyzing alternative depression questions in the 2019\textendash 20 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Nevertheless, for the same period determinants of mental health were similar in the NHIS, BRFSS, and HPS data. We also explored whether the pandemic affected physical health and behaviors by examining Emergency Medical Services (EMS) data calls related to behavior, overdoses, suicide attempts, and gun violence. (Notably, gun violence and opioid overdose calls increased after lockdowns, but suicide-related calls decreased). Finally, we looked at whether over the long run there is a relationship between poor mental health and deaths of despair in a geographic area and found some support for that possibility. Our results highlight two findings: (1) Scholars investigating mental and behavioral health trends must be cautious about relying too heavily on a single dataset; results generated from different data may differ considerably. (2) High metropolitan rates of depression and anxiety may be correlated with higher rates of suicide and overdose years later.},

Investigating this fiercely pious community at a grassroots level, Darren Dochuk uses the stories of religious leaders, including Billy Graham, as well as many colorful, lesser-known figures to explain how evangelicals organized a powerful political machine. This machine made its mark with Barry Goldwater, inspired Richard Nixon's ``Southern Solution,'' and achieved its greatest triumph with the victories of Ronald Reagan. Based on entirely new research, the manuscript has already won the prestigious Allan Nevins Prize from the Society of American Historians.

We contend that the persistent residual variation may, in part, be the result of conceptual and methodological problems in the operationalization of SES. These include inadequate attention to the content validity of SES measures and insufficient adjustments for SES differences across racial groups. Using data from the 1997e2007 U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 9932), we use longitudinal and multi-level measures of SES and apply a propensity score adjustment strategy to examine the black/ white disparity in self-rated health. Compared to conventional regression estimates that yield unexplained racial health gaps, propensity score adjustment accounts for the entire racial disparity in selfrated health. Results suggest that previous studies may have inadequately adjusted for differences in SES across racial groups, that social factors should be carefully and conscientiously considered, and that acknowledgment of the possibility of incomplete SES adjustments should be weighed before any inferences to non-SES etiology can be made.},

In an innovative program at Iliff School of Theology, funded by a Lilly Economic Challenges Facing Future Ministers (ECFFM) grant, selected students in a self-care course used compassion-based spiritual practices to become more aware of their financial stress and avoidant coping in the hopes of facilitating more integrated, complex theologies of financial stress grounded in embodied and relational goodness. These students continued this theologically reflexive learning process in courses on financial literacy, leadership, and fundraising (initially for their own scholarships). At the end of their academic year, they demonstrated decreased guilt and shame and increased self-compassion about their student debt along with increased confidence and ability to successfully engage in scholarship fundraising activities.},

Correlation coefficient analysis revealed that a higher spirituality score correlated with greater personal accomplishment, but also related to greater emotional exhaustion and greater depersonalization. Clergy were more likely to have greater emotional exhaustion and depersonalization if they employed coping strategies of venting, disengagement, and self-blame. Acceptance, active coping, planning and positive reframing were correlated with greater personal accomplishment, but less strongly with emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. A higher spirituality score correlates with greater personal accomplishment but also greater emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Certain coping strategies, including acceptance, active coping, planning, and positive reframing may also protect against burnout. The implications of these relationships are discussed.},

This hypothesis was tested using four waves of a six-wave longitudinal study based on a representative sample (N =313) of the residents of Dresden, Germany. The advantages of longitudinal designs were comprehensively used including the testing of different time lags, the testing of reversed causation, and modelling of unmeasured third variables that may have spuriously created the pattern of observed relationships. Structural equation modelling provided evidence for the proposed mediation mechanism and suggests that time lags of at least 2 years are required to demonstrate the effects.},

Results identified both common cross-cultural experiences and symptoms as well as uniquely described symptoms (e.g., lacking peace, being discriminated against) not typically targeted by the intervention or included on standardized measures of intervention effects. We discuss implications for adapting mental health interventions in low- and middle-income countries and assessing effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The only constant in life is change, or so goes the familiar refrain. But when it comes to research on multiracial congregations, studying change has largely been overlooked. Questions loom about the changing prevalence, leadership, and composition of racially diverse congregations. Using three waves of data from the National Congregations Study (1998, 2006, and 2012), we offer an overarching examination of racial composition in U.S. congregations across approximately 15 years. Both the percentage of multiracial congregations and the amount of racial/ethnic diversity in congregations have increased. The increase has been most dramatic in Protestant churches. In addition, blacks are more common in the pulpit and the pews of America's multiracial congregations than they were in the past. Blacks now surpass Latinos as the group most likely to worship with whites in multiracial congregations. Location and religious tradition continue to be influential factors in a congregation's racial diversity, but the significance of several congregational characteristics have changed over time. We discuss the implications of these findings.},

Is diversity associated with attendance growth, stability, or decline? A popular assumption from the Church Growth Movement is that cultural homogeneity is a foundation for growth, but recent research challenges this long-standing belief. We test these competing views with longitudinal data from over 10,000 congregations in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). We examine the relationship between changes in racial/ethnic diversity and changes in average weekly attendance over a 19-year time period (1993\textendash 2012). In spite of the ELCA's denominational push for racial diversity in its local churches, our analysis finds increasing racial diversity associated with decreasing average attendance, most notably during the 1990s. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our findings for congregations and denominations.},

We find that racial diversity within congregations has increased substantially between 1998 and 2019. There are more congregations in which no one racial or ethnic group comprises more than 80 percent of the people, congregations' average diversity level has increased, and the percentage of all-white congregations has declined. Nearly a quarter of evangelical churches now have no one ethnic group constituting more than 80 percent of the people, a rate comparable to what we observe among Catholic churches. Moreover, congregations that meet this 80-percent threshold are more likely to be led by black clergy in 2019 than they were in 1998.

Physiological measures were collected during multiple individual sessions with 30 kindergarten children, ages 5 to 6 years. Three sessions were scheduled at 2-week intervals and included a negative affect task as a challenge. Cardiovascular and cortisol responses to the challenge were assessed. Results indicated that baseline measures of RSA and heart period were stable across time. Baseline cortisol levels were not stable. The change in RSA in response to a task that elicited emotional responses was not stable over time. Consistent with findings observed in adults and older children, changes in RSA were related to the cortisol response. Children who increased cortisol over the course of Session 1 exhibited larger decreases in RSA than children who did not show increased cortisol levels. In addition, the children who had larger decreases in RSA had higher ratings of sociability on the Colorado Childhood Temperament Inventory. Greater decreases in heart period during the task were associated with lower ratings of shyness. The relation of RSA measures to ratings of social competence supports the Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 1995, 2001), which suggests that the ability to engage and disengage with objects and people in one's environment, necessary for social competence, is related to the regulation of vagal control of the heart. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The simulation uses empirical values for the determinants of fertility from Eastern Japan itself as well as the best available studies of comparable populations. This procedure reveals that in several decades of the eighteenth century, at least 40 \% of pregnancies must have ended in either an induced abortion or an infanticide. In addition, the simulation results imply a rapid decline in the incidence of infanticide and abortion during the nineteenth century, when in a reverse fertility transition, this premodern family-planning regime gave way to a new age of large families.},

Under most political circumstances, this is a difficult question to answer, but the novel coronavirus pandemic allows us to understand how partisan animus contributes to opinion formation. Using a two-wave panel that spans the outbreak of COVID-19, we find a strong association between citizens' levels of partisan animosity and their attitudes about the pandemic, as well as the actions they take in response to it. This relationship, however, is more muted in areas with severe outbreaks of the disease. Our results make clear that narrowing of issue divides requires not only policy discourse but also addressing affective partisan hostility.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression is the most common mental disorder, and suicide is its most serious consequence. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate preliminary evidence for the P4 screener as a brief measure to assess potential suicide risk. Method: The P4 screener was prospectively evaluated in 2 randomized effectiveness trials of primary care (January 2005\textendash June 2008; N = 250) and oncology patients (March 2006\textendash August 2009; N = 309). Potential suicide ideation was assessed at 5 time points in both trials: baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The P4 screener asks about the ``4 P's'': past suicide attempts, suicide plan, probability of completing suicide, and preventive factors. Patients were classified as minimal, lower, and higher risk based upon responses to these 4 items. Results: A suicide assessment was triggered 1 or more times by 17.6\% (44 of 250) of Stepped Care for Affective Disorders and Musculoskeletal Pain (SCAMP) participants and 16.5\% (51 of 309) of Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) participants at some point in the trial. Of the patients who triggered a suicide assessment, the majority (29 of 44 in SCAMP and 27 of 51 in INCPAD) were classified as minimal risk by the algorithm. Only 1 (0.4\%) of the SCAMP participants and 5 (1.6\%) of the INCPAD participants were classified as higher risk. Among the latter, the most common factors preventing patients from attempting suicide were the ``4 F's'': faith, family, future hope, and fear of failing in their attempt. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that the P4 screener may be useful in assessing potential suicide risk in the clinical care of depressed patients as well as in clinical research.

Burnout has been found to exist in a multitude of occupations that are service-, or people, oriented. As a large portion of the role of a pastor involves contact with individuals, pastors may experience burnout. It is through a pastoral lens that burnout, and concepts related to burnout such as emotional labour, role salience, differentiation of self, and differentiation of self in Christ, are examined. Methods to cope with burnout such mindfulness and prayer are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {Structural equation models (SEMs) with latent variables are routinely used in social science research, and are of increasing importance in biomedical applications. Standard practice in implementing SEMs relies on frequentist methods. This chapter provides a simple and concise description of an alternative Bayesian approach. We provide a brief overview of the literature, describe a Bayesian specification of SEMs, and outline a Gibbs sampling strategy for model fitting. Bayesian inferences are illustrated through an industrialization and democratization case study from the literature. The Bayesian approach has some distinct advantages, due to the availability of samples from the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters and latent variables, that we highlight. These posterior samples provide important information not contained in the measurement and structural parameters. As is illustrated using the case study, this information can often provide valuable insight into structural relationships.},

Whereas research finds that this cycle influences women's mating preferences, we propose that it might also change women's political and religious views. Building on theory suggesting that political and religious orientation are linked to reproductive goals, we tested how fertility influenced women's politics, religiosity, and voting in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. In two studies with large and diverse samples, ovulation had drastically different effects on single versus married women. Ovulation led single women to become more liberal, less religious, and more likely to vote for Barack Obama. In contrast, ovulation led married women to become more conservative, more religious, and more likely to vote for Mitt Romney. In addition, ovulatoryinduced changes in political orientation mediated women's voting behavior. Overall, the ovulatory cycle not only influences women's politics, but appears to do so differently for single versus married women.},

Restricted network access denies involvement in the exchange and creation of tacit knowledge and ultimately, organizational resources and power. The strength of network ties may also impact upon the quality of knowledge exchanged within networks, its level of complexity and strategic relevance.

Generally, American research concludes there is a positive relation, whereas research in the Low Countries concludes this relation is negative. However, the conclusions of the latter research tradition might be premature, because inaccurate religiosity measures were used. The results of this study suggest that both frequency of church attendance and belief salience are no longer signi cantly related to racism. Four religious attitudes are described, based on individuals inclusion or exclusion of transcendence, and preference for symbolic or literal interpretation. Orthodoxy (literal, transcendent) and External Critique (literal, non-transcendent) were signi cantly positively related to racism, whereas Relativism (symbolic, non-transcendent) was signi cantly negatively related to it. Second Na\"ivet\'e (symbolic, transcendent) at rst sight turned out not to be signi cantly related to racism. However; a path analysis\textemdash in which some important background variables such as age and education were included\textemdash suggested the existence of an indirect negative relation. Overall it looks as if the privatisation of religion has reached new heights. Thus nowadays, studies of the relation between religion and racism need to focus on the cognitive (rather than behavioural) aspects of how people deal with the religious realm.},

Mennonite theology, with its emphasis on a theology of peace, shares similar concerns. J. Denny Weaver takes issue with the dominance of the Anselmian satisfaction theory, particularly because of its inherent violence.1 In The Nonviolent Atonement, he articulates a view that ``charts a path of nonviolent atonement through territory strewn with images and assumptions of violence.''2 He argues for narrative Christus Victor as a superior and inherently nonviolent atonement motif. However, I challenge Weaver's claim. I contend that Mennonite theologians would find better resources for articulating a nonviolent approach in the work of Anthony Bartlett in his recent book, Cross Purposes: The Violent Grammar of Christian Atonement. Below I will raise questions about Weaver's work and attempt to explain how Bartlett's paradigm offers a better approach.},

  abstract = {Heather Vacek's book, Madness: American Protestant Responses to Mental Illness reminds us that the story of mental illness in the United States is inextricably bound to the story of religion. She traces this history through the lenses of five ``paradigmatic Protestants'' who devoted their lives to understanding and treating mental illness: Cotton Mather, Benjamin Rush, Dorothea Dix, Anton Boisen, and Karl Menninger. These figures cover the period from the early eighteenth to the late twentieth centuries.A major strength of this book is the care and attention Vacek exercises in situating each of these figures in their social and historical contexts. She avoids the temptation to lionize any of these figures. Instead, she shows that although motivated by a sincere Christian desire to alleviate suffering, each of these people was limited by popular perceptions of mental illness, institutional realities, and professional turf wars in the medical community. In addition, Vacek demonstrates that because effective treatment of mental illness by health professionals remained elusive, religious voices were central to debates about the care and treatment for the mentally ill. In other domains of medicine, religious voices occupied a much more marginalized position. A final strength of this book is the way that Vacek highlights how discussions about whether doctors, psychiatrists, or psychologists were qualified to treat mental illness\textemdash coupled with waning public support for tax dollar sponsored institutional care\textemdash created a situation where effective treatment for the mentally ill got lost. Throughout much of the time period covered, people suffering from mental illnesses often had to endure squalid, overcrowded, and inhumane environments.},

Approximately half of this decline stems from the increase in the proportion of people reporting no religion, who, for the most part, do not attend religious services. The other portion of this decline is attributable to eroding attendance rates among Catholics, particularly older Catholics, and Protestants in Que\textasciiacute bec. Attendance rates for Protestants outside of Que\textasciiacute bec show signs of increase. The reported increase in weekly attendance in Canada by the Project Canada surveys and cited by Bibby as a possible indicator of a religious renaissance is revealed as an artifact in the data due to an oversample of Protestants. I find another weighting problem in the Canadian Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating that leads to underestimates of aggregate religious attendance rates.},

Traditionally, the TSST is administered with staff physically present with participants, which limits the participant populations that can be exposed to the TSST. We describe an adaptation of the TSST to remote, online delivery over video-conferencing, which we call the internet-delivered Trier Social Stress Test (iTSST). This adaption has participants use wearable, self-administered ECG monitors received and returned via mail. Fifty participants were recruited to take part in a pilot study evaluating stress-reduction interventions and completed the iTSST at two occasions separated by approximately 12 weeks. Perceived stress and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured during both administrations of the iTSST. Forty-one participants completed both assessments and were included in the set of analyses. Both administrations were characterized by an increase in self-reported stress and reduction in self-reported relaxation from the resting phase to the speech task, which returned to baseline during recovery. In terms of HRV, we observed a significant parasympathetic response to the iTSST in 90\% of participants, evidenced by a decrease in RMSSD and increase in heart rate from resting to the speech task, which recovered during the recovery phase. In terms of repeatability, there was little evidence of habituation and the iTSST elicited a stress response during both the initial administration and the 12-week follow-up. While the utility is limited by the lack of a measure of sympathetic and HPA-axis activity, the iTSST represents a promising research tool when physically interacting with participants is not feasible.},

This study adds to current knowledge by examining the impact of British Columbia's Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), established in 1973, which severely restricts subdivision and nonagricultural uses for more than 4.7 million hectares of farmland. To determine the extent to which the ALR preserves farmland by reducing or removing the development option, a multilevel hedonic pricing model is used to estimate the impact of land use, geographic, and zoning characteristics on farmland value near the capital city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Using sales data from 1974 through 2008, the model demonstrates a changing ALR impact over time that varies considerably by improved and unimproved land types. In 2008, landowners paid 19\% less for the typical improved farmland parcel within the ALR versus that outside it. This suggests that would-be developers expect permanency in the zoning law, and prefer non-ALR zoned land. However, ALR land that is unimproved has a premium of 55\%, suggesting that this land is more valuable for agriculture than for development. Farmland located closer to the city or the commuting highway commands a premium if it has a residence on it, with a residence also explaining why smaller agricultural properties sell at higher prices. However, it appears that zoning by itself is insufficient to protect farmland; other policies likely need to be implemented in conjunction with zoning to protect agricultural land.},

Contrary to this position, this research demonstrates that megachurches enjoy a long history in Protestantism. An important example from the 16th Century Huguenot architect Jacques Perret reveals an early Protestant vision for a large, multi-functional worship space. Soon after, this vision became realized in bricks and mortar. Revivalism and the Institutional Church Movement of the 19th and early 20th Centuries provide further connections between megachurches and the past. Revivalism provided the motivation for Protestants to go out and reach the masses, and the Institutional Church Movement provided the infrastructure to attract, convert, and nurture them. The demographic shifts that occurred following WWII led to the proliferation of churches in post-war America. This meant that large churches became increasingly visible, but journalists and social commentators mistook their increase in prevalence for lack of historical precedent. Pastors and other leaders, capitalizing on the appeal of innovation, reinforced this view. This research offers an important corrective that helps situate megachurches in the United States in their proper context.},

Recently relocated clergy report higher levels of self-efficacy and higher workplace morale compared to those who do not relocate.

With the rapid growth of megachurches in the United States, a negative relationship between size and frequency of attendance could serve to accelerate aggregate declines in attendance.

To test this theory, we used survey data from the Clergy Health Initiative Panel Survey to examine the relationship between perceived and received social support and their association with depressive symptoms in clergy (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,288). Overall, analyses revealed perceived support had a weak association with received support. Greater perceived support had a significant relationship with lower depressive symptoms. In contrast, greater received support had only a small relationship with lower depressive symptoms, which was fully mediated by perceived support. Our results raise questions about the effectiveness of many clergy social support interventions, which often aim to boost the quality and/or quantity of received social support. We suggest it may be more advantageous to boost perceptions of social support, possibly through cognitive reframing or positive mental health interventions.},

As local congregations, national denominations, and international affiliations of Christians wrestle with this issue, significant conflict and division has arisen and continues to rage. At the center of this debate are so-called ``arguments from creation,'' that is, arguments that look to the natural or revealed ``order of things'' to discern God's design for appropriate sexual behavior. This mode of theological argumentation has a long history in the tradition of natural theology, which assumes that divine direction (and even divine speech) is inherent in creaturely capacities. In this article, I will demonstrate that New Testament scholarship is agreed that in Romans 1:18-32 (the key NT text on the issue), Paul is not making an argument per se against homosexuality. Instead, this passage fits within the larger claim that he is trying to make throughout the book of Romans about Jew-Gentile relations. What Paul condemns here is the human propensity to judge others based on supposedly intrinsic qualities. He is using a stereotypical Jewish understanding of Gentiles, and turning it back against those who would argue for some special innate characteristic within Jews that makes them special and within Gentiles that makes them depraved.},

We conducted qualitative interviews of 69 caregivers in four countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Cambodia, and India (Hyderabad and Nagaland), and across four religious traditions: Christian (Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant), Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu. We asked respondents to describe the importance of religion for their becoming a caregiver, the way in which religion has helped them make sense of why children are orphans, and how religion helps them face the challenges of their occupation. Using qualitative descriptive analysis, three major themes emerged. Respondents discussed how religion provided a strong motivation for their work, reported that religious institutions were often the way in which they were introduced to caregiving as an occupation, and spoke of the ways religious practices sustain them in their work. They rarely advanced religion as an explanation for why OVC exist\textemdash only when pressed did they offer explicitly religious accounts. This study has implications for OVC care, including the importance of engaging religious institutions to support caregivers, the significance of attending to local religious context, and the vital need for research outside of Christian contexts.},

  abstract = {The experience of becoming an ex is common to most people in modern society. Unlike individuals in earlier cultures who usually spent their entire lives in one marriage, one career, one religion, one geographic locality, people living in today's world tend to move in and out of many roles in the course of a lifetime. During the past decade there has been persistent interest in these "passages" or "turning points," but very little research has dealt with what it means to leave behind a major role or incorporate it into a new identity. Helen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh's pathbreaking inquiry into the phenomenon of becoming an ex reveals the profundity of this basic aspect of establishing an identity in contemporary life.  Ebaugh is herself an ex, having left the life of a Catholic nun to become a wife, mother, and professor of sociology. Drawing on interviews with 185 people, Ebaugh explores a wide range of role changes, including ex-convicts, ex-alcoholics, divorced people, mothers without custody of their children, ex-doctors, ex-cops, retirees, ex-nuns, and\textemdash perhaps most dramatically\textemdash transsexuals. As this diverse sample reveals, Ebaugh focuses on voluntary exits from significant roles. What emerges are common stages of the role exit process\textemdash from disillusionment with a particular identity, to searching for alternative roles, to turning points that trigger a final decision to exit, and finally to the creation of an identify as an ex.  Becoming an Ex is a challenging and influential study that will be of great interest to sociologists, mental health counselors, members of self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Parents Without Partners, those in corporate settings where turnover has widespread implications for the organization, and for anyone struggling through a role exit who is trying to establish a new sense of self.},

Although these policies represent some progress, women and minorities remain underrepresented within the workplace as a whole and even more so when you look at high-level positions. They also tend to be less well paid. How is it that discrimination remains so prevalent in the American workplace despite the widespread adoption of policies designed to prevent it?  One reason for the limited success of antidiscrimination policies, argues Lauren B. Edelman, is that the law regulating companies is broad and ambiguous, and managers therefore play a critical role in shaping what it means in daily practice. Often, what results are policies and procedures that are largely symbolic and fail to dispel long-standing patterns of discrimination. Even more troubling, these meanings of the law that evolve within companies tend to eventually make their way back into the legal domain, inconspicuously influencing lawyers for both plaintiffs and defendants and even judges. When courts look to the presence of antidiscrimination policies and personnel manuals to infer fair practices and to the presence of diversity training programs without examining whether these policies are effective in combating discrimination and achieving racial and gender diversity, they wind up condoning practices that deviate considerably from the legal ideals.},

Researchers generally find that participants in this migration were positively selected from their region of origin, in terms of educational attainment and urban status, and that they fared relatively well in their destinations. To fully measure the migrants' success, however, a comparison with those who remained in the South is necessary. This article uses data from the U.S. Census to compare migrants who left the South with their southern contemporaries who stayed behind, both those who moved within the South and the sedentary population. The findings indicate that migrants who left the South did not benefit appreciably in terms of employment status, income, or occupational status. In fact, inter-regional migrants often fared worse than did southerners who moved within the South or those who remained sedentary. These results contradict conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of exiting the South and suggest the need for a revisionist interpretation of the experiences of those who left.},

  abstract = {Psychological research has found that women score higher on most measures of the traits, motivations, and values that predict helping others, and women are more likely to help family and friends. However, sex differences in the institutional helping behaviors of volunteering and charitable giving are small. This article seeks to explain this apparent contradiction with the hypotheses that men have more resources and more social capital than women, which compensates for their lower level of motivation. The article tests these hypotheses using data from the 1995 Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey. The data show partial support for these hypotheses, as men score higher on measures of income, education, trust, and secular social networks. However, women have broader social networks through religious participation.},

This article extends the literature in this area by elaborating a set of direct, mediating, and moderating links between multiple dimensions of religious involvement and psychological distress and well-being. Relevant hypotheses are then tested using data from the 1995 Detroit Area Study. Among our key findings: the frequency of church attendance bears a positive association with well-being and an inverse association with distress; the frequency of prayer has a slight inverse link with well-being and a weak positive association with distress; belief in eternal life is positively associated with well-being but unrelated to distress; in general, the net effects of these religious variables are not mediated by the risk of social stressors or by access to social or psychological resources; other religious variables, including measures of church-based social support, are unrelated to distress or well-being; and there is limited evidence of stress-buffering effects, but not stress-exacerbating effects, of religious involvement. The limitations of the study are discussed, and several implications and promising directions for further research on religion and health/well-being are identified.},

Traditional prejudice and discrimination approaches explain these gaps in hiring, promotion, satisfaction, and well-being by pointing to the prejudice of people within organizations such as peers, managers, and executives. Grounded in social identity threat theory, this theoretical review instead argues that particular situational cues\textemdash{} often communicated by well-meaning, largely unprejudiced employees and managers\textemdash signal to stigmatized groups whether their identity is threatened and devalued or respected and affirmed. First, we provide an overview of how identity threat shapes the psychological processes of racial and ethnic minorities by heightening vigilance to certain situational cues in the workplace. Next, we outline several of these cues and their role in creating and sustaining perceptions of identity threat (or safety). Finally, we provide empirically grounded suggestions that organizations may use to increase identity safety among their employees of color. Taken together, the research demonstrates how situational cues contribute to disparate psychological experiences for racial and ethnic minorities at work, and suggests that by altering threatening cues, organizations may create more equitable, respectful, and inclusive environments where all people may thrive.},

In that the potential ramifications of grace are considerable, greater scientific attention to it seems warranted in both of its dimensions: Perceptions of divine grace received and grace enacted in one's life. Our working hypothesis is that humanly experienced divine grace has the capacity to profoundly enhance and elevate human flourishing: thus grace fits well within the field of positive psychology, particularly as it intersects with the psychology of religion and spirituality.},

However, most research fails to control for the gendered distribution of social roles (e.g. paid work and domestic work) and so does not compare men and women in similar positions. In this short report, we examine the distribution of minor psychiatric morbidity (measured by the 12 item General Health Questionnaire) amongst men and women working in similar jobs within three white-collar organisations in Britain, after controlling for domestic and socioeconomic circumstances. Data from self-completion questionnaires were collected in a Bank (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2176), a University (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1641) and the Civil Service (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6171). In all three organisations women had higher levels of minor psychiatric morbidity than men, but the differences were not great; in only the Civil Service sample did this reach statistical significance. We conclude that generalisations about gender differences in minor psychiatric morbidity can be unhelpful, as these differences may vary depending on the context of the study. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {There is evidence that depressive symptoms in men are often undiagnosed and untreated. It has been suggested that men may find it difficult to seek help because culturally dominant (or hegemonic) forms of masculinity are characterised by emotional control and a lack of vulnerability, while depression is often associated with powerlessness and the uncontrolled expression of emotion. However, very little research exists which examines men's experiences of depression. We analysed 16 in-depth interviews with a wide range of men with depression in the UK Our analysis explored associations between depression and men's gender identities. We found that, as part of recovery from depression, it was important for men to reconstruct a valued sense of themselves and their own masculinity. The most common strategy was to incorporate values associated with hegemonic masculinity into narratives (being `one of the boys', re-establishing control, and responsibility to others). While this strategy could aid recovery, there was also evidence that the pressures of conforming to the standards of hegemonic masculinity could contribute to suicidal behaviour. In contrast, a minority of men had found ways of being masculine which were outside hegemonic discourses. They emphasised their creativity, sensitivity and intelligence, explicitly reflected on different models of masculinity and redefined their `difference' as a positive feature. Our research demonstrates that it is possible to locate men who can, and will, talk about depression and their feelings; thus generalisations about depressed men always being silent are misleading. While some men will have the resources to construct identities that resist culturally dominant definitions of masculinity, many others will find it more useful (and perhaps less threatening) to re-interpret potentially feminising experiences as `masculine'. Health professionals need to be aware of the issues raised by men's narratives which emphasise control, strength and responsibility to others.},

  abstract = {It is commonly asserted that while women have longer life expectancy than men, they have higher rates of morbidity, particularly for minor and psychological conditions. However, most research on gender and health has taken only limited account of the gendered distribution of social roles. Here we investigate gender dierences in morbidity whilst controlling, as far as possible, for one major role, namely participation in paid employment. There is substantial segregation of the labour market by gender; men and women typically work dierent hours in dierent occupations which involve varying conditions and diering rewards and costs. Here, we examine men and women working full-time for the same employer. This paper reports on a postal survey of employees (1112 men and 1064 women) of a large British bank. It addresses three main questions: do gender dierences in minor morbidity remain if we compare men and women who are employed in similar circumstances (same industry and employer)? What is the relative importance of gender, grade of employment within the organisation, perceived working conditions and orientation to gender roles for minor morbidity? Finally, are these factors related to health dierentially for men and women? There were statistically signi\textregistered cant gender dierences amongst these full-time employees in recent experience of malaise symptoms, but not in physical symptoms or GHQ scores. Controlling for other factors did not reduce the gender dierences in malaise scores and produced a weak, but signi\textregistered cant, gender dierence in GHQ scores. However, gender explained only a small proportion of variance, particularly in comparison with working conditions. Generally similar relationships between experience of work and occupational grade and morbidity were observed for men and women. Throughout the paper, we attempt to problematize gender, recognising that there are similarities between women and men and diversity amongst women and amongst men. However, we conclude that the gendered nature of much of adult life, including paid work, continues to shape the experiences and health of men and women at the end of the twentieth century. \# 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The issue of centering has been discussed in the literature, but it is still widely misunderstood. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed overview of grand mean centering and group mean centering in the context of 2-level MLMs. The authors begin with a basic overview of centering and explore the differences between grand and group mean centering in the context of some prototypical research questions. Empirical analyses of artificial data sets are used to illustrate key points throughout. The article provides a number of practical recommendations designed to facilitate centering decisions in MLM applications.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Missing information is inevitable in longitudinal studies, and can result in biased estimates and a loss of power. One approach to this problem is to impute the missing data to yield a more complete data set. Our goal was to compare the performance of 14 methods of imputing missing data on depression, weight, cognitive functioning, and self-rated health in a longitudinal cohort of older adults. Methods: We identified situations where a person had a known value following one or more missing values, and treated the known value as a ``missing value.'' This ``missing value'' was imputed using each method and compared to the observed value. Methods were compared on the root mean square error, mean absolute deviation, bias, and relative variance of the estimates. Results: Most imputation methods were biased toward estimating the ``missing value'' as too healthy, and most estimates had a variance that was too low. Imputed values based on a person's values before and after the ``missing value'' were superior to other methods, followed by imputations based on a person's values before the ``missing value.'' Imputations that used no information specific to the person, such as using the sample mean, had the worst performance. Conclusions: We conclude that, in longitudinal studies where the overall trend is for worse health over time and where missing data can be assumed to be primarily related to worse health, missing data in a longitudinal sequence should be imputed from the available longitudinal data for that person. \'C 2003 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Objective To present nationally representative data on prevalence and correlates of MDD by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSMIV) criteria, and on study patterns and correlates of treatment and treatment adequacy from the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Design Face-to-face household survey conducted from February 2001 to December 2002. Setting The 48 contiguous United States. Participants Household residents ages 18 years or older (N=9090) who responded to the NCS-R survey. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence and correlates of MDD using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), 12-month severity with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology SelfReport (QIDS-SR), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and the WHO disability assessment scale (WHO-DAS). Clinical reinterviews used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Results The prevalence of CIDI MDD for lifetime was 16.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 15.1-17.3) (32.6-35.1 million US adults) and for 12-month was 6.6\% (95\% CI, 5.9-7.3) (13.1-14.2 million US adults). Virtually all CIDI 12-month cases were independently classified as clinically significant using the QIDS-SR, with 10.4\% mild, 38.6\% moderate, 38.0\% severe, and 12.9\% very severe. Mean episode duration was 16 weeks (95\% CI, 15.1-17.3). Role impairment as measured by SDS was substantial as indicated by 59.3\% of 12-month cases with severe or very severe role impairment. Most lifetime (72.1\%) and 12-month (78.5\%) cases had comorbid CIDI/DSM-IV disorders, with MDD only rarely primary. Although 51.6\% (95\% CI, 46.1-57.2) of 12-month cases received health care treatment for MDD, treatment was adequate in only 41.9\% (95\% CI, 35.947.9) of these cases, resulting in 21.7\% (95\% CI, 18.1-25.2) of 12-month MDD being adequately treated. Sociodemographic correlates of treatment were far less numerous than those of prevalence. Conclusions Major depressive disorder is a common disorder, widely distributed in the population, and usually associated with substantial symptom severity and role impairment. While the recent increase in treatment is encouraging, inadequate treatment is a serious concern. Emphasis on screening and expansion of treatment needs to be accompanied by a parallel emphasis on treatment quality improvement.},

Articles were first selected by their abstract and title, and then, we retrieved full-text English articles. References of selected articles were searched for additional relevant studies. Results We identified 31 guidelines and found no consensus in CCA methods. Most methods included use of committees, focus groups, and back translations. Evidence for the best methods is lacking, although clues indicate that back translation may not be mandatory. Conclusion Several methods are available for CCA of questionnaires. According to experts only, most would achieve comparable results, and choosing one is a matter of preference and logistic. More evidence is needed to support recommendations.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among US adults during vs before the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationally representative survey study used 2 population-based surveys of US adults aged 18 or older. During COVID-19, estimates were derived from the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study, conducted from March 31, 2020, to April 13, 2020. Before COVID-19 estimates were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2017 to 2018. Data were analyzed from April 15 to 20, 2020. EXPOSURES The COVID-19 pandemic and outcomes associated with the measures to mitigate it. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression symptoms, defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff of 10 or higher. Categories of depression symptoms were defined as none (score, 0-4), mild (score, 5-9), moderate (score, 10-14), moderately severe (score, 15-19), and severe (score, Ն20). RESULTS A total of 1470 participants completed the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (completion rate, 64.3\%), and after removing those with missing data, the final during\textendash COVID-19 sample included 1441 participants (619 participants [43.0\%] aged 18-39 years; 723 [50.2\%] men; 933 [64.7\%] non-Hispanic White). The pre\textendash COVID-19 sample included 5065 participants (1704 participants [37.8\%] aged 18-39 years; 2588 [51.4\%] women; 1790 [62.9\%] non-Hispanic White). Depression symptom prevalence was higher in every category during COVID-19 compared with before (mild: 24.6\% [95\% CI, 21.8\%-27.7\%] vs 16.2\% [95\% CI, 15.1\%-17.4\%]; moderate: 14.8\% [95\% CI, 12.6\%-17.4\%] vs 5.7\% [95\% CI, 4.8\%-6.9\%]; moderately severe: 7.9\% [95\% CI, 6.3\%-9.8\%] vs 2.1\% [95\% CI, 1.6\%-2.8\%]; severe: 5.1\% [95\% CI, 3.8\%-6.9\%] vs 0.7\% [95\% CI, 0.5\%-0.9\%]). Higher risk of depression symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with having lower income (odds ratio, 2.37 [95\% CI, 1.26-4.43]), having less than \$5000 in savings (odds ratio, 1.52 [95\% CI, 1.02-2.26]), and exposure to more stressors (odds ratio, 3.05 [95\% CI, 1.95-4.77]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that prevalence of depression symptoms in the US was more than 3-fold higher during COVID-19 compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with lower social resources, lower economic resources, and greater exposure to stressors (eg, job loss) reported a greater burden of depression symptoms. Post\textendash COVID-19 plans},

Based on in-depth qualitative data combined from two individual studies, we illustrate the processes by which white institutional spaces create a complex environment where people of color must navigate racial narratives, ideologies, and discourses, while simultaneously attempting to achieve institutional success to reap the material rewards of these elite institutional settings. In these distinct environments, people of color experience an unequal distribution of emotional labor as a result of negotiating both everyday racial micro-aggressions and dismissive dominant ideologies that deny the relevance of race and racism. As a result they must actively seek ways to engage in forms of resistance that promote counter narratives and protect themselves from denigration while minimizing the risk of severe consequence. Our data suggest that a more nuanced conceptualization of resistance and the context in which resistance occurs is needed in order to understand the everyday experiences of people of color.Cargas Sociales imposibles: Instituciones consideradas de Blancos, Trabajo Emocional y Micro-ResistenciaLouwanda Evans,Este art\'iculo explora las conexiones entre los espacios institucionalestradicionalmente con mayor\'ia de trabajadores blancos, trabajo emocional y la resistencia a trav\'es de las experiencias compartidas de la gente de color en las Facultades o Escuelas de \'elite de derecho y de la industria de la aviaci\'on comercial.

Methods: We systematically evaluated available data on the efficacy of light therapy in nonseasonal depression. Results: We identified 62 reports among which 15 met our predefined selection criteria. The available data show evidence for the efficacy of light therapy as an adjuvant treatment to antidepressants. Trials that evaluated light therapy alone (without antidepressants) in nonseasonal depression yielded inconsistent results. Limitations: Most of the studies extracted poorly controlled the issue of blindness and were limited by small sample sizes. Publication bias may have distorted our estimation of the effect of light therapy. Conclusions: Overall, bright light therapy is an excellent candidate for inclusion into the therapeutic inventory available for the treatment of nonseasonal depression today, as adjuvant therapy to antidepressant medication. Future clinical trials of light therapy should distinguish homogenous subgroups of depressed patients in order to evaluate whether light therapy may eventually be considered as stand-alone treatment for specific subgroups of patients with nonseasonal depression.},

A need now exists for more comprehensive, reliable, concise measurement of religious and spiritual (r/s) struggles through a scale that covers multiple domains. This article describes the development and initial validation of a 26-item measure, the Religious and Spiritual Struggles (RSS) Scale. The measure assesses six domains of r/s struggle: divine (negative emotion centered on beliefs about God or a perceived relationship with God), demonic (concern that the devil or evil spirits are attacking an individual or causing negative events), interpersonal (concern about negative experiences with religious people or institutions; interpersonal conflict around religious issues), moral (wrestling with attempts to follow moral principles; worry or guilt about perceived offenses by the self), doubt (feeling troubled by doubts or questions about one's r/s beliefs), and ultimate meaning (concern about not perceiving deep meaning in one's life). Study 1 used factor analytic techniques in two adult samples (Ns ϭ 400 and 483) to refine the item pool for the RSS. Study 2, which sampled 1141 undergraduates, showed very good fit for a six-factor model using confirmatory factor analysis. Study 2 also provided evidence of convergent, discriminant and predictive validity by relating RSS scores to measures of religiousness, r/s struggle and mental health. Several potentially important demographic differences emerged on the RSS. For example, undergraduates without committed romantic relationships and those who self-identified as homosexual reported greater r/s struggles across multiple domains.},

In the model-based framework (MB), under the hypothesis that the underlying model is correctly specified, using survey weights in regression analysis potentially involves a loss of efficiency. In a design-based perspective (DB), weighted estimates are both design consistent and can provide robustness to model mis-specification. In this paper, I suggest that the choice of using survey weights can be seen in a regression diagnostic set. The survey data analyst should check if the design information included in survey weights has some explanatory power in describing the model outcome. To accomplish this task a set of econometric tests is suggested, that could be supplemented by the analysis of model features under the two strategies.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are a family of computational models that have led to a dramatical improvement of the state of the art in several domains such as image, voice or text analysis. These methods provide a framework to model complex, non-linear interactions in large datasets, and are naturally suited to the analysis of hierarchical data such as, for instance, longitudinal data with the use of recurrent neural networks. In the other hand, cohort studies have become a tool of importance in the research field of epidemiology. In such studies, variables are measured repeatedly over time, to allow the practitioner to study their temporal evolution as trajectories, and, as such, as longitudinal data. This paper investigates the application of the advanced modelling techniques provided by the deep learning framework in the analysis of the longitudinal data provided by cohort studies. Methods: A method for visualizing and clustering longitudinal dataset is proposed, and compared to other widely used approaches to the problem on both real and simulated datasets. Results: The proposed method is shown to be coherent with the preexisting procedures on simple tasks, and to outperform them on more complex tasks such as the partitioning of longitudinal datasets into non-spherical clusters. Conclusion: Deep artificial neural networks can be used to visualize longitudinal data in a low dimensional manifold that is much simpler to interpret than traditional longitudinal plots are. Consequently, practitioners should start considering the use of deep artificial neural networks for the analysis of their longitudinal data in studies to come.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Empirical studies of the association between neighbourhood food environments and individual obesity risk have found mixed results. One possible cause of these mixed findings is the variation in neighbourhood geographic scale used. The purpose of this paper was to examine how various neighbourhood geographic scales affected the estimated relationship between food environments and obesity risk. Design: Cross-sectional secondary data analysis. Setting: Salt Lake County, Utah, USA. Participants: 403 305 Salt Lake County adults 25\textendash 64 in the Utah driver license database between 1995 and 2008. Analysis: Utah driver license data were geo-linked to 2000 US Census data and Dun \& Bradstreet business data. Food outlets were classified into the categories of large grocery stores, convenience stores, limited-service restaurants and full-service restaurants, and measured at four neighbourhood geographic scales: Census block group, Census tract, ZIP code and a 1 km buffer around the resident's house. These measures were regressed on individual obesity status using multilevel random intercept regressions. Outcome: Obesity. Results: Food environment was important for obesity but the scale of the relevant neighbourhood differs for different type of outlets: large grocery stores were not significant at all four geographic scales, limited-service restaurants at the medium-to-large scale (Census tract or larger) and convenience stores and full-service restaurants at the smallest scale (Census tract or smaller). Conclusions: The choice of neighbourhood geographic scale can affect the estimated significance of the association between neighbourhood food environments and individual obesity risk. However, variations in geographic scale alone do not explain the mixed findings in the literature. If researchers are constrained to use one geographic scale with multiple categories of food outlets, using Census tract or 1 km buffer as the neighbourhood},

Results: Most (71\%) reported feeling inadequately trained to recognize mental illness. The most common cause of mental illness that clergy members cited was medical (37\%), yet when asked to comment on two case vignettes, many reported that they would provide counseling instead of referral. When referrals were made, 41\% considered shared religious beliefs between parishioner and provider important, and 15\% considered shared beliefs essential. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for collaboration between mental health professionals and the clergy. Knowledge of a patient's belief system may help improve crisis interventions and treatment planning for religious patients. (Psychiatric Services 59: 437\textendash 440, 2008)},

The current study explored whether short-term supportive interactions between parents of children with disabilities and members of their supportive network (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 40 dyads) influenced the physiological stress responses (as measured by salivary cortisol) of both interactants. Results indicated that receiving support in a short interaction resulted in parents experiencing decreases to their physiological stress, though the quality of the support played a key role in determining how beneficial the interaction was in this context. These results suggest the importance of considering support quality when examining the influence of social support on physical outcomes for support recipients.},

Our approach is based on the insight that people everywhere are connected through in-person social networks, such as kin, friendship, and contact networks. We illustrate how this insight can be used to derive an estimator for tracking the digital divide in access to the Internet, an increasingly important dimension of population inequality in the modern world. We conducted a large-scale empirical test of our approach, using an online sample to estimate Internet adoption in five countries (n {$\approx$} 15,000). Our test embedded a randomized experiment whose results can help design future studies.

We also find strong cohort variations in SES disparities in the mean levels of health and health trajectories. The effect of education on health slightly decreases across successive cohorts. By contrast, the income gap in health trajectories diverges for earlier cohorts but converges for most recent cohorts. Both effects are more pronounced in rural areas. Given that these cohort effects are opposite those reported in recent U.S. studies, we discuss China's unique social, economic, and political settings. We highlight the association between SES and health behaviors, China's stage of epidemiologic transition, and the changing power of the state government and its implications for health care.},

Using the 2008/9 U.S. Congregational Life Survey's national sample of clergy from multiple religious traditions, we find support for our hypotheses. Clergy who experience more stress, work more hours, or are bi-vocational have higher odds of obesity. Those who take a day off each week, have taken a sabbatical, or are involved in a support group experience lower odds. For Protestant clergy, being involved in a support group or taking a day off moderates the association between certain stressful occupational conditions and obesity. \'O 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Structuration theory and template analysis were used to identify higher-order codes related to strengths and challenges of human agents, organizations and societal forces. Emergent themes and supporting interview quotations are presented to highlight common patterns across organizations, including strengths such as staff commitment, client outcomes, and resourceful communities, as well as challenges such as lack of staff, funding, and parental involvement. Through the analysis we uncover insights about the recursive relationship between micro and macro realities in Kenyan NGOs and the accompanying human and social transformations that result from providing services to OVC.},

  abstract = {Mattick and Clarke's (1998) Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS) are commonly used self-report measures that assess 2 dimensions of social anxiety. Given the need for short, readable measures, this research proposes short forms of both scales. Item-level analyses of readability characteristics of the SIAS and SPS items led to the selection of 6 items from each scale for use in the short forms. The SIAS and SPS short forms had reading levels at approximately the 6th and 5th grade level, respectively. Results using nonclinical (Study 1: N = 469) and clinical (Study 2: N = 145) samples identified these short forms as being factorially sound, possessing adequate internal consistency, and having strong convergence with their full-length counterparts. Moreover, these short forms showed convergence with other measures of social anxiety, showed divergence from measures assessing related constructs, and predicted concurrent interpersonal functioning. Recommendations for the use of these short forms are discussed.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of Mattick and Clarke's (1998) Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS) led 2 independent groups of researchers to develop short forms of these measures (Fergus, Valentiner, McGrath, Gier-Lonsway, \& Kim, 2012; Peters, Sunderland, Andrews, Rapee, \& Mattick, 2012). This 3-part study examined the psychometric properties of Fergus et al.'s and Peters et al.'s short forms of the SIAS and SPS using an American nonclinical adolescent sample in Study 1 (N = 98), American patient sample with an anxiety disorder in Study 2 (N = 117), and both a South Korean college student sample (N = 341) and an American college student sample (N = 550) in Study 3. Scores on both sets of short forms evidenced adequate internal consistency, interitem correlations, and measurement invariance. Scores on Fergus et al.'s short forms, particularly their SIAS short form, tended to capture more unique variance in scores of criterion measures than did scores on Peters et al.'s short forms. Implications for the use of these 2 sets of short forms are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

We propose a theoretical model that shifts attention from the individual to the organization and is derived from a more general theoretical model of religious commitment. Testing the causal model with an expanded range of organizational measures and structural equation models, we conclude that congregational beliefs, requirements, and networks serve to mutually support each other in generating an exclusiveness that produces a high level of giving. When combined with size of congregation, income, and denominational affiliation the proposed theoretical model fits the data quite well and explains a high level of the variance. \'O 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We review claims that between 1970 and 2005 American society fragmented along lines of cultural politics, social class, immigration, race, or lifestyle. Taking the twentieth century as historical context, we weigh evidence for both main variants of the fragmentation thesis\textemdash that there is an increasing divide between two Americas, or that America is fragmenting into a variety of ``little worlds that touch but do not interpenetrate.'' We find a well-documented, widening gap in social class, whether measured by education or income. We also find that political elites and activists are demonstrably more polarized in 2005 than they were in 1970; this gap's effect on the electorate is debatable, however. Caveats aside, there is little evidence for increasing fragmentation of America along lines of race, ethnicity, or immigration status. American cultural tastes increasingly cluster into distinct lifeways, but there is little evidence about what effects, if any, this development has. The loudest claims of fragmentation, those concerning value issues, are based on the most contested evidence, but the widening gap between Americans by income and education\textemdash which receives less popular attention\textemdash is substantial and serious.},

Across all model specifications Chinese Americans tend to enroll and graduate from more prestigious colleges than Whites and most other racial/ethnic-nativity groups in the analysis. In contrast, economic disadvantage accounts for Mexican Americans' enrollment at less prestigious colleges than Whites.

Methods: Self-reported height and weight data came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the National Health Interview Survey, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for the years 1999 to 2016. Measured height and weight data were available from NHANES. BMI was calculated from height and weight; obesity was defined as BMI {$\geq$} 30. Results: In all three surveys, mean self-reported height was higher than mean measured height in NHANES for both men and women. Mean BMI from self-reported data was lower than mean BMI from measured data across all surveys. For women, mean self-reported weight, BMI, and obesity prevalence in the National Health Interview Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were lower than self-report in NHANES. The distribution of BMI was narrower for self-reported than for measured data, leading to lower estimates of obesity prevalence. Conclusions: Self-reported height, weight, BMI, and obesity prevalence were not identical across the three surveys, particularly for women. Patterns of misreporting of height and weight and their effects on BMI and obesity prevalence are complex.},

  abstract = {This paper examines men's lifetime physical intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration across eight low- and middle-income countries to better understand key risk factors that interventions can target in order to promote gender equality and reduce IPV. We use data from men (n = 7806) that were collected as part of the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), India, Mexico, and Rwanda. Results show that there is wide variation across countries for lifetime self-reported physical violence perpetration (range: 17\% in Mexico to 45\% in DRC), men's support for equal roles for men and women, and acceptability of violence against women. Across the sample, 31\% of men report having perpetrated physical violence against a partner in their lifetime. In multivariate analyses examining risk factors for men ever perpetrating physical violence against a partner, witnessing parental violence was the strongest risk factor, reinforcing previous research suggesting the inter-generational transmission of violence. Additionally, having been involved in fights not specifically with an intimate partner, permissive attitudes towards violence against women, having inequitable gender attitudes, and older age were associated with a higher likelihood of ever perpetrating physical IPV. In separate analyses for each country, we found different patterns of risk factors in countries with high perpetration compared to countries with low perpetration. Findings are interpreted to identify key knowledge gaps and directions for future research, public policies, evaluation, and programming.},

  abstract = {Food insecurity has been a persistent problem in the U.S., and yet over the past three decades, federally funded food programs have become more restrictive. Scholars and policymakers have inquired whether the nonprofit sector is increasing its food provision activities to address this unmet need. This study analyzes data from the U.S. Census and a nationally representative survey of religious congregations in the U.S. to examine trends in food insecurity and congregation-based food provision between 1998 and 2012. The objective of the study is to investigate the extent to which congregation-based food provision fluctuated with national food insecurity prevalence for the overall population, and for subgroups vulnerable to this condition. Results show an over-time correspondence between the prevalence of food-insecure households and the prevalence of congregations that provide food. Parallel patterns are observed between food insecurity in disproportionately affected subpopulations (e.g., African-Americans and immigrants) and food provision in the congregations likely to serve those households. These findings indicate that congregations are helping meet the needs of food-insecure households. However, research suggests that congregations and nonprofits are not an adequate substitute for federally funded programs. Policy recommendations include expanding access to federally funded programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to more immigrants and other groups vulnerable to food insecurity, as well as providing more systematic financial or federal support and quality control of congregation-based efforts.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Faith-based organizations may be effective in addressing HIV-related disparities, but few interventions have been implemented across diverse churches. The Facilitating Awareness to Increase Testing for HIV (FAITH) intervention harnessed peer leadership to decrease HIV stigma and promote HIV testing in African American and Latino congregations. A pilot study found more consistent effects among Latino congregations. This process evaluation evaluates implementation of FAITH to better understand the pilot study's findings. Methods: Data sources included HIV education and peer leader workshop evaluation forms, participant views of the community's perspective of HIV, and peer leader follow-up interviews. Data were triangulated with systematic observation notes and analyzed using process-related themes of recruitment, reach, context, implementation, dose-delivered, and fidelity. Results: At the Latino churches (compared to the African American church), facilitators spent more time addressing community-based misconceptions about HIV. The peer leader model was well received, especially among Latino participants, and most said that after the workshop they felt comfortable speaking with others about HIV-related topics. Latino peer leaders reported speaking with up to 20 people within their social networks (particularly with family members); African Americans reported up to 4. Implementation challenges at the African American church may have contributed to the limited intervention effects. Nevertheless, we found the peer motivator model feasible and acceptable across diverse faith settings. Conclusion: Peer-based models within faith settings are promising for addressing HIV. However, differences among groups in HIV knowledge, social network characteristics and norms, and church preferences may influence overall effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background: The present study aimed to investigate how subjective self-reported stress is associated with objective heart rate variability (HRV)-based stress and recovery on workdays. Another aim was to investigate how physical activity (PA), body composition, and age are associated with subjective stress, objective stress, and recovery. Methods: Working-age participants (n = 221; 185 women, 36 men) in this cross-sectional study were overweight (body mass index, 25.3\textendash 40.1 kg/m2) and psychologically distressed ({$\geq$}3/12 points on the General Health Questionnaire). Objective stress and recovery were based on HRV recordings over 1\textendash 3 workdays. Subjective stress was assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale. PA level was determined by questionnaire, and body fat percentage was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: Subjective stress was directly associated with objective stress (P = 0.047) and inversely with objective recovery (P = 0.046). These associations persisted after adjustments for sex, age, PA, and body fat percentage. Higher PA was associated with lower subjective stress (P = 0.037). Older age was associated with higher objective stress (P {$<$} 0.001). After further adjustment for alcohol consumption and regular medication, older age was associated with lower subjective stress (P = 0.043). Conclusions: The present results suggest that subjective self-reported stress is associated with objective physiological stress, but they are also apparently affected by different factors. However, some of the found associations among these overweight and psychologically distressed participants with low inter-individual variation in PA are rather weak and the clinical value of the present findings should be studied further among participants with greater heterogeneity of stress, PA and body composition. However, these findings suggest that objective stress assessment provides an additional aspect to stress evaluation. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information for developing stress assessment methods.},

RESULTS \textemdash{} Based on the results from 16 cohorts, we performed a meta-analysis of estimates of relative risk (RR) and incident diabetes. The random-effects summary RRs were 5.17 (95\% CI 3.99 \textendash{} 6.69) for the 1999 World Health Organization definition (ten cohorts); 4.45 (2.41\textendash{} 8.22) for the 1999 European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance definition (four cohorts); 3.53 (2.84 \textendash{} 4.39) for the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program definition (thirteen cohorts); 5.12 (3.26 \textendash{} 8.05) for the 2005 American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute definition (five cohorts); and 4.42 (3.30 \textendash 5.92) for the 2005 International Diabetes Federation definition (nine cohorts). The fixed-effects summary RR for the 2004 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/American Heart Association definition was 5.16 (4.43\textendash{} 6.00) (six cohorts). Higher number of abnormal components was strongly related to incident diabetes. Compared with participants without an abnormality, estimates of RR for those with four or more abnormal components ranged from 10.88 to 24.4. Limited evidence suggests fasting glucose alone may be as good as metabolic syndrome for diabetes prediction. CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} The metabolic syndrome, however defined, has a stronger association with incident diabetes than that previously demonstrated for coronary heart disease. Its clinical value for diabetes prediction remains uncertain.},

  abstract = {Mindfulness meditation can reduce harmful reactivity to events, and is considered an effective means of promoting healthy coping responses. In the current study, mindfulness meditation was investigated as a method for buffering individuals against the negative effects of social rejection. Specifically this study investigated whether mindfulness meditation is especially effective in promoting resilience and adaptive coping for individuals who are most vulnerable to the negative effects of social rejection, namely those with low self-esteem. 133 participants received rejecting or non-rejecting feedback from a false other participant in the context of an online dating interaction. Next, half of the participants engaged in a brief mindfulness meditation and psychological and physiological responses were assessed. Findings revealed that mindfulness meditation was associated with a reduction in harmful responses to rejection for low self-esteem individuals (less implicit self-focus) but an increase in harmful responses for high self-esteem individuals (increased rumination and increased systolic blood pressure). These findings suggest that while mindfulness meditation may buffer low self-esteem individuals from some negative effects of rejection, it may not provide the same benefits for high self-esteem individuals. Implications of these findings for the growing use of mindfulness meditation as a coping tool are discussed.},

A common understanding is that religion depresses women's rights in general and reproductive and abortion rights in particular. The literature on reproductive rights, however, is disproportionately focused on Western cases, and is limited in its definition of religion as a variable. What happens, though, when we switch to a more inclusive framework? To what extent do a variety of religious variables correlate with policy on reproductive rights outside of the Western context? We examine the relevance of the religion-abortion link in a broad comparative framework. We introduce the Comparative Abortion Index and test the effects of a wide range of denominations and religious characteristics on reproductive rights. Our study finds that reproductive rights correlate only with some religious denominations, while others have no significance. Additionally, while religiosity correlates with reproductive policy, variables such as religious freedom, separation of religion and state and religious diversity show no correlative effect. The comparative analyses suggest that the connection between religion and development in general\textemdash and in the area of women's rights in particular\textemdash is far more nuanced than previously thought.},

  abstract = {This study proposed that clergy burnout is distinguished from burnout among helping professionals by the unique stresses of ministry and the personality characteristics of ministers. A survey was distributed to 460 ministers and helping professionals (mental health professionals, nurses, other medical professionals, and teachers) associated with two Protestant denominations. The research participants were 102 American pastors and 86 helping professionals. Situational and personality factors correlated with burnout in previous research were examined. The study utilized the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Spiritual Well-Being Scale as outcome measures. As hypothesized, among clergy but not helping professionals, Depersonalization (DP), a subscale of the MBI, uniquely correlated with role ambiguity ( r = .40, p {$<$} .001), "adrenaline exhaustion" (r = .29, p {$<$} .01), agreeableness ( r = -.34, p {$<$} .001), and hostility ( r = .27, p {$<$} .01). Emotional Exhaustion (EE), another MBI subscale, and DP correlated negatively with years in work ( r = -.38 and -.39, both p {$<$} .001). Among helping professionals but not among clergy, contrary to expectation, EE correlated with inadequate personal boundaries (r = .34, p {$<$} .01), exposure to crisis (r = .43, p {$<$} .001), inadequate staffing (r = .53, p {$<$} .001), and somatic complaints (r = .57, p {$<$} .001). Among both groups, EE correlated with role overload (r = .41 and .63 respectively, both p {$<$} .001), involvement in emotional triangles (r = .47 and .58, both p {$<$} .001), assault by members or clients (r =.36 and. 50, both p {$<$} .001), neurotic personality (r = .57 and .59, both p {$<$} .001), and spiritual problems (r = .53 and.52, both p {$<$} .001). DP correlated with neurotic personality (r = .49 and .32, both p {$<$} .001) and spiritual problems (r = .55, p {$<$} .001, and r = .32, p {$<$} .01). The results suggested that vague job descriptions are a factor in clergy burnout and inadequate personal boundaries, overexposure to crisis, and inadequate staffing are factors in helping professional burnout. The results also suggested that burnout includes a spiritual or existential component. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Despite the existence of hundreds, if not thousands, of articles and dozens of books, there is little agreement on how to adequately analyze APC data. This article begins with a brief overview of APC analysis, discussing how one can interpret APC effects in a causal way. Next, we review methods that obtain point identification of APC effects, such as the equality constraints model, Moore-Penrose estimators, and multilevel models. We then outline techniques that entail point identification using measured causes, such as the proxy variables approach and mechanism-based models. Next, we discuss a general framework for APC analysis grounded in partial identification using bounds and sensitivity analyses. We conclude by outlining a general step-by-step procedure for conducting APC analyses, presenting an empirical example examining temporal shifts in verbal ability.},

A key obstacle to these efforts is the linear dependence among the three time scales. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they have suffered from either ad hoc assumptions or extreme sensitivity to small differences in model specification. After briefly reviewing past work, we outline a new approach for identifying temporal effects in population-level data. Fundamental to our framework is the recognition that it is only the slopes of an APC model that are unidentified, not the nonlinearities or particular combinations of the linear effects. One can thus use constraints implied by the data along with explicit theoretical claims to bound one or more of the APC effects. Bounds on these parameters may be nearly as informative as point estimates, even with relatively weak assumptions. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we examine temporal effects in prostate cancer incidence and homicide rates. We conclude with a discussion of guidelines for further research on APC effects.},

Cardinal and ordinal measures are repeatedly used to produce nominal classifications of essential worth. Conversely, presumptively natural kinds provide the basis for new measurement and scoring systems. Over time, the iterative application of nominal classifications and quantifying measures produce involuted, nested systems whose structure and origins are hard to disentangle. While careful studies of earlier systems and methods have often uncovered these arbitrary aspects, newer technical tools for classification are at once substantially more opaque than their predecessors and more likely to be employed on very large scales. The classification situations to which they give rise thus have the potential to produce the sort of naturalized facticity characteristic of classical social facts.},

Recently, scholars have begun to define virtues in ways that improve the prospects for measuring virtue constructs, but a coordinated, programmatic approach is necessary for success in virtue measurement. A brief overview of the construct of virtue includes six key elements that can structure virtue assessment design. Recent research on the trait/situation problem suggests that situational factors do not obviate traits. Veridicality issues such as social desirability and positive illusions are significant challenges for selfreport virtue measurement. In summary self-report measures, these challenges can be met with a number of methods, including directly assessing social desirability and item construction to remove social desirability. These challenges can also be met using other-reports, experience sampling, or experimental procedures. A brief discussion of construct validity in virtue measurement leads to the conclusion that many studies with a variety of methods are necessary to establish valid measures of virtue.},

Setting Framingham Heart Study social network. Participants 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003. Main outcome measures Happiness measured with validated four item scale; broad array of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties. Results Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people's happiness extends up to three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of one's friends' friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and those who are central in the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25\% (95\% confidence interval 1\% to 57\%). Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8\%, 0.2\% to 16\%), siblings who live within a mile (14\%, 1\% to 28\%), and next door neighbours (34\%, 7\% to 70\%). Effects are not seen between coworkers. The effect decays with time and with geographical separation. Conclusions People's happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected. This provides further justification for seeing happiness, like health, as a collective phenomenon.},

In this paper a convenience sample of 155 priests serving with the Roman Catholic Church in Italy have been assessed on the Purpose in Life Scale (PILS) as an independent measure of well-being and concurrently on the two scales, SEEM and SIMS. Crucially for confirming the idea of balanced affect, there was a significant interaction between the effects of SEEM and SIMS scores on scores recorded on the PILS, confirming that the mitigating effects of satisfaction in ministry on purpose increased with increasing levels of emotional exhaustion.},

Personality provided significant prediction of individual differences in both personal happiness and work-related psychological health. However, personal happiness provided additional protection against work-related emotional exhaustion and additional enhancement of work-related satisfaction.

Francis proposes a balanced affect model of burnout according to which negative affect (emotional exhaustion) is offset by positive affect (satisfaction in ministry). This study draws on data provided by around 658 clergy serving in the Church of England to test this balanced affect model. Employing independent measures of burnout, the data demonstrated the significance of the interaction term between positive affect and negative affect in predicting individual differences in burnout. In other words, as positive affect increases the effects of negative affect decrease.},

The authors tested this build hypothesis in a field experiment with working adults (n ϭ 139), half of whom were randomly-assigned to begin a practice of loving-kindness meditation. Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the hedonic treadmill effect.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular activity recorded at rest and during mental stress in the laboratory was studied in relation to ambulatory recorded cardiovascular activity at work and at home. Fifty-five Type A men (M = 42.4 years) underwent a standardized laboratory mental stress protocol in which systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded at baseline and during a 15 min mental arithmetic task (MAT). On a subsequent day, ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at 20 minute intervals for 12-14 hr during normal activities at home and at work. Subjects completed a behavioral diary concurrently with each cuff inflation. High and Low groups were identified based upon a median split of their cardiovascular response levels at baseline and during the MAT. Subjects with high systolic blood pressure levels during the MAT had high systolic blood pressure at home, at work, during physical activity, and when they reported being 'stressed'. Baseline systolic blood pressure in the laboratory was less consistently related to ambulatory systolic pressure across ambulatory conditions. Diastolic blood pressure at baseline was related to ambulatory diastolic blood pressure at work, at home, and when resting. Diastolic blood pressure during the MAT was associated with higher diastolic pressure at work and at home. Heart rate at baseline and during the MAT was related to heart rate at work and during physical activity. Change scores derived by subtracting mean values during the MAT from baseline resting levels were not associated with ambulatory blood pressures or heart rates under any daily conditions. In the best case, systolic blood pressure measured during the MAT was related to systolic blood pressure during physical activity, to systolic blood pressure and heart rate during mental stress, to systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest, and to systolic blood pressure and heart rate at work but not at home. We conclude that levels of blood pressure and heart rate measured in the laboratory, but not reactivity (i.e, change scores) during the MAT, are related to blood pressure and heart rate levels recorded in the natural environment, especially in the work setting.},

Numerous congregational characteristics increase the likelihood that congregations provide them: the presence of openly HIV positive people in the congregation, having a group that assesses their community's needs, religious tradition, and openness to gays and lesbians. By building on previous research, this study provides further information about the scope of religious congregations' involvement with PLWHA and also insight into which congregations may be willing to collaborate with other organizations to provide care for PLWHA.},

Although most of these studies monitor the presence of PLWHIV in the general population or specific communities, some assess the presence of PLWHIV in organizations. One type of organization that has not been examined, yet could potentially play a large role in caring for PLWHIV, is the religious congregation. In this study, we estimate the proportion of US religious congregations that have PLWHIV and examine whether congregations that are in contact with populations with high HIV prevalence and incidence rates are more likely to have PLWHIV using data from a nationally representative sample of congregations and the 2000 Census. Over 10,000 congregations have PLWHIV, and congregations containing, open to, or located in areas with populations with high HIV prevalence and incidence rates are more likely to have them. This study offers new insight into the presence of HIV in the United States and provides information about which congregations may be amenable to serving as sites of HIV programs.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Resilience is a construct of increasing interest, but validated scales measuring resilience factors among adults are scarce. Here, a scale named the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) was crossvalidated and compared with measures of personality (Big Five/5PFs), cognitive abilities (Raven's Advanced Matrices, Vocabulary, Number series), and social intelligence (TSIS). All measures were given to 482 applicants for the military college. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the fit of the five-factor model, measuring `personal strength', `social competence', `structured style', `family cohesion' and `social resources'. Using Big Five to discriminate between well adjusted and more vulnerable personality profiles, all resilience factors were positively correlated with the well adjusted personality profile. RSA-personal strength was most associated with 5PFs-emotional stability, RSA-social competence with 5PFs-extroversion and 5PFs-agreeableness, as well as TSIS-social skills, RSA-structured style with 5PFs-conscientiousness. Unexpectedly but interestingly, measures of RSA-family cohesion and RSA-social resources were also related to personality. Furthermore, the RSA was unrelated to cognitive abilities. This study supported the convergent and discriminative validity of the scale, and thus the inference that individuals scoring high on this scale are psychologically healthier, better adjusted, and thus more resilient.

  abstract = {Objectives The Psychosocial Factors Outcome Study (PFOS) investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and the relationship of psychosocial factors to mortality in outpatients with heart failure (HF). Background Considerable evidence links psychosocial factors to coronary heart disease mortality and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The contribution of psychosocial factors independent of disease severity to HF outpatient mortality is not well elucidated. Methods Patients (N = 153) from 20 Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) sites participated in the PFOS. SCD-HeFT provided demographic, medical history, and cardiac data. Participants completed questionnaires to assess psychosocial status at PFOS entry. Results Depression and anxiety were common in HF outpatients (36\% Beck Depression Inventory-II z13; 45\% State Trait Anxiety Inventory z40). Depression, anxiety, and social support amount did not differ in the SCD-HeFT treatment groups: implantable cardioverter defibrillator, amiodarone, and placebo medication. Fifteen (9.8\%) patients died during mean follow-up at 23.6 months (SD = 8.2). In Cox regression controlling for treatment, depression, anxiety, and social isolation separately predicted mortality; perceived HF-specific functional status did not. Depression (ln) [ P = .04, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.81] and social isolation ( P = .04, HR = 2.25), but not anxiety, predicted mortality independent of demographics, clinical predictors, and treatment. When simultaneously including significant demographic, clinical, and psychosocial predictors and treatment groups, depression (ln) ( P = .022, HR = 2.2) and social isolation ( P = .094, HR = 1.75) predicted mortality. All-cause mortality was 12\% for depressed patients and 9\% for others. Conclusion This study finds a high prevalence of anxiety and confirms the high prevalence of depression in the HF outpatient population. Depression and social isolation predicted mortality independent of demographic and clinical status in HF outpatients. (Am Heart J 2006;152:940.e12940.e8.)},

Factor analyses have consistently revealed a single factor which accounts for a large portion of the total test variance (ranging from 58\% to 74\%). Mean inter-item correlations have remained high across samples (typically between .60 and .70), Cronbach's alpha was .98, and the 24 items comprising the scale loaded (usually considerably) higher than .61 on the single factor in the various studies.

Using a nationally representative sample of black congregations, this study engages the debate about the institutional centrality of black churches by focusing on their response to HIV/AIDS. Although many congregational studies treat black churches as a monolithic whole, this analysis identifies heterogeneity among black churches that shapes their responsiveness to social issues. Contrary to prior claims, a congregation's liberal-conservative ideological orientation does not significantly affect its likelihood of having an HIV/AIDS program. Beyond assessing churches' internal characteristics, this study uses institutional theory to analyze churches as open systems that can be influenced by their surrounding environment. It demonstrates that externally engaged congregations are significantly more likely to have a program. These results indicate that black churches maintain institutional centrality by engaging their external environment.},

Although the United States is becoming more racially diverse, organizational elites remain disproportionately white, and this mismatch contributes to increasing racial inequality. This article examines whether and how leaders of color within predominantly white organizations can help their organizations address racial inequality. Our analysis uses data from a national study of politically oriented civic organizations and ethnographic fieldwork within one predominantly white organization. We draw on institutional work research, the outsider-within concept, and insights from critical whiteness theory to explain how leaders of color can use their position and ``critical standpoint'' to help guide their organization toward advancing racial equality. The qualitative analysis shows how such leaders, when empowered, help their organization address race internally by (a) providing alternatives to white-dominated perspectives, (b) developing tools to educate white members about racial inequality, and (c) identifying and addressing barriers to becoming a more racially diverse organization. The qualitative analysis also shows how leaders of color help their organization address race externally by (a) sharing personal narratives about living in a white-dominated society and (b) brokering collaborations with organizations led by people of color. This research has implications for organizations seeking to promote social equality: Organizational leaders from marginalized status groups can help their organizations address social inequality, if those leaders possess a critical standpoint and sufficient organizational authority.},

However, despite the theoretical postulations that social networks are crucial for alleviating psychological distress, no study has yet empirically confirmed the causality of this relationship. Thus, we used the random-effects generalized least squares method to investigate the effect of one- and two-year lagged values for involvement in social networks on psychological distress. Nine years of longitudinal data were extracted from a nationally representative survey in Japan (``The Longitudinal Survey of Middle-aged and Older Persons''). We utilized the Kessler 6 (K6) score to measure psychological distress among 15,242 respondents aged 50\textendash 59 years in the baseline year (2005), and stratified participants into three layers of social networks: inner (well-established friendship ties and participating in hobby activates), intermediary (neighborly ties), and outer (involvement in community activities). We found highly significant and negative associations between all three layers and K6 scores, with the strongest association being for the inner layer. We further observed that one-year lagged involvement in the inner and intermediary layers led to significantly lower K6 scores. However, the protective influences of social networks generally diminished over time. In addition, the protective influences of social network involvement on psychological distress were stronger for women than for men. Furthermore, involvement in social networks was especially important for improving mental health among people with psychological distress. These findings would be important for policymaking to prevent mental health deterioration among middle-aged adults in Japan.},

  abstract = {Background: It is challenging to conduct and quickly disseminate findings from in-depth qualitative analyses, which can impede timely implementation of interventions because of its time-consuming methods. To better understand tradeoffs between the need for actionable results and scientific rigor, we present our method for conducting a framework-guided rapid analysis (RA) and a comparison of these findings to an in-depth analysis of interview transcripts. Methods: Set within the context of an evaluation of a successful academic detailing (AD) program for opioid prescribing in the Veterans Health Administration, we developed interview guides informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and interviewed 10 academic detailers (clinical pharmacists) and 20 primary care providers to elicit detail about successful features of the program. For the RA, verbatim transcripts were summarized using a structured template (based on CFIR); summaries were subsequently consolidated into matrices by participant type to identify aspects of the program that worked well and ways to facilitate implementation elsewhere. For comparison purposes, we later conducted an in-depth analysis of the transcripts. We described our RA approach and qualitatively compared the RA and deductive in-depth analysis with respect to consistency of themes and resource intensity. Results: Integrating the CFIR throughout the RA and in-depth analysis was helpful for providing structure and consistency across both analyses. Findings from the two analyses were consistent. The most frequently coded constructs from the in-depth analysis aligned well with themes from the RA, and the latter methods were sufficient and appropriate for addressing the primary evaluation goals. Our approach to RA was less resource-intensive than the in-depth analysis, allowing for timely dissemination of findings to our operations partner that could be integrated into ongoing implementation. Conclusions: In-depth analyses can be resource-intensive. If consistent with project needs (e.g., to quickly produce information to inform ongoing implementation or to comply with a policy mandate), it is reasonable to consider using RA, especially when faced with resource constraints. Our RA provided valid findings in a short timeframe, enabling identification of actionable suggestions for our operations partner.},

Moreover, a number of additional studies have been published since the publication of these reviews. We conducted an updated meta-analysis of prospective studies to assess the association between depression and the risk of CHD. Methods Relevant prospective studies investigating the association between depression and CHD were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science search (up to April 2014) and from reviewing reference lists of obtained articles. Either a random-effects model or fixed-effects model was used to compute the pooled risk estimates when appropriate. Results Thirty prospective cohort studies with 40 independent reports met the inclusion criteria. These groups included 893,850 participants (59,062 CHD cases) during a follow-up duration ranging from 2 to 37 years. The pooled relative risks (RRs) were 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.22-1.40) for CHD and 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.18-1.44) for myocardial infarction (MI). In the subgroup analysis by follow-up duration, the RR of CHD was 1.36 (95\%CI, 1.24-1.49) for less than 15 years follow-up, and 1.09 (95\%CI, 0.96-1.23) for equal to or more than 15 years follow-up. Potential publication bias may exist, but correction for this bias using trim-and-fill method did not alter the combined risk estimate substantially. Conclusions The results of our meta-analysis suggest that depression is independently associated with a significantly increased risk of CHD and MI, which may have implications for CHD etiological research and psychological medicine.},

  abstract = {Background: The consumption of sweetened beverages, refined foods, and pastries has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of depression in longitudinal studies. However, any influence that refined carbohydrates has on mood could be commensurate with their proportion in the overall diet; studies are therefore needed that measure overall intakes of carbohydrate and sugar, glycemic index (GI), and glycemic load. Objective: We hypothesized that higher dietary GI and glycemic load would be associated with greater odds of the prevalence and incidence of depression. Design: This was a prospective cohort study to investigate the relations between dietary GI, glycemic load, and other carbohydrate measures (added sugars, total sugars, glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, starch, carbohydrate) and depression in postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study at baseline between 1994 and 1998 (n = 87,618) and at the 3-y follow-up (n = 69,954). Results: We found a progressively higher dietary GI to be associated with increasing odds of incident depression in fully adjusted models (OR for the fifth vs. first quintile: 1.22; 95\% CI: 1.09, 1.37), with the trend being statistically significant (P = 0.0032). Progressively higher consumption of dietary added sugars was also associated with increasing odds of incident depression (OR for the fifth vs. first quintile: 1.23; 95\% CI: 1.07, 1.41; P-trend = 0.0029). Higher consumption of lactose, fiber, nonjuice fruit, and vegetables was significantly associated with lower odds of incident depression, and nonwhole/refined grain consumption was associated with increased odds of depression. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that high-GI diets could be a risk factor for depression in postmenopausal women. Randomized trials should be undertaken to examine the question of whether diets rich in low-GI foods could serve as treatments and primary preventive measures for depression in postmenopausal women.

The non-stationarity becomes more profound when HRV data are measured in intrinsically non-stationary environments, such as social stress. In general, HRV data measured in such situations are more difficult to analyze than those measured in constant environments. In this paper, we analyze HRV data measured during a social stress test using two multiscale approaches, the adaptive fractal analysis (AFA) and scale-dependent Lyapunov exponent (SDLE), for the purpose of uncovering differences in HRV between chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients and their matched-controls. CFS is a debilitating, heterogeneous illness with no known biomarker. HRV has shown some promise recently as a non-invasive measure of subtle physiological disturbances and trauma that are otherwise difficult to assess. If the HRV in persons with CFS are significantly different from their healthy controls, then certain cardiac irregularities may constitute good candidate biomarkers for CFS. Our multiscale analyses show that there are notable differences in HRV between CFS and their matched controls before a social stress test, but these differences seem to diminish during the test. These analyses illustrate that the two employed multiscale approaches could be useful for the analysis of HRV measured in various environments, both stationary and non-stationary.},

The relationship children establish with their temporary caregivers can be a crucial factor in their lives. However, little research has been conducted with caregivers working in institutional settings regarding their experience and the relationship they establish with the children they care for. This article presents the results of a qualitative study conducted with 43 caregivers working in eight different residential children's homes in Chile. The information was gathered through focus groups, and thematic analysis was conducted. The results show that caregivers report their experience of work and their relationship with children very positively and that this is characterized by their emotional involvement with children. This perspective appears to differ from that observed in large institutions in Europe, where there is some evidence that a more impersonal approach is predominant. However, it is acknowledged that this is based on caregiver perceptions which may or may not reflect cultural variations. The conclusion highlights the potential positive impact that caregivers can have on children's lives, alongside some factors that negatively affect caregivers' work, which could inform policy and procedures in order to provide better care for these children who (for various reasons) remain in residential care rather than family-based care.},

It can be supposed that the disruption of the normal facial structure and the long-standing pressure of treatment from birth to adulthood bring about a range of life stressors which may lead to a long-lasting impact on affected subjects throughout their lives. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess different aspects of psychosocial stress in affected individuals. Methods The study was divided into two parts: first, the Trier Social Stress Test which involves uncontrollability and high levels of social-evaluative stress under real conditions and second, the query of various aspects of coping with psychosocial stress. The test group consisted of 30 affected adult subjects, and an equally sized control group of unaffected volunteers. Cortisol dysregulation was determined by saliva samples before and after stress induction. Meanwhile, participants were asked to complete the SVF 120 stress-coping questionnaire. Results The analysis of saliva samples showed a similar baseline concentration as well as a similar increase in cortisol levels after stress induction for both groups. Subsequently, the decline in cortisol concentrations was significantly faster in the CLP group (course: p{$<$}0.001; groups: p = 0.102; interaction: p = 0.167). The evaluation of the stress-coping questionnaire revealed a significantly shorter rumination about a stressful event in individuals with CLP-related malformations (p = 0.03). Conclusion We conclude that adults with CLP have significantly better stress-coping strategies than their healthy peers. Trial Registration German Clinical Trials Organization DRKS00003466},

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-\$t\$ prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

  abstract = {Background Longitudinal data are data in which each variable is measured repeatedly over time. One possibility for the analysis of such data is to cluster them. The majority of clustering methods group together individual that have close trajectories at given time points. These methods group trajectories that are locally close but not necessarily those that have similar shapes. However, in several circumstances, the progress of a phenomenon may be more important than the moment at which it occurs. One would thus like to achieve a partitioning where each group gathers individuals whose trajectories have similar shapes whatever the time lag between them. Method In this article, we present a longitudinal data partitioning algorithm based on the shapes of the trajectories rather than on classical distances. Because this algorithm is time consuming, we propose as well two data simplification procedures that make it applicable to high dimensional datasets. Results In an application to Alzheimer disease, this algorithm revealed a ``rapid decline'' patient group that was not found by the classical methods. In another application to the feminine menstrual cycle, the algorithm showed, contrarily to the current literature, that the luteinizing hormone presents two peaks in an important proportion of women (22\%).},

  abstract = {Previous studies of hormonal and neurophysiological changes in response to psychological stress in humans have produced contrasting findings due to differing experimental procedures and consistent individual variability. Habituation effects, which influence physiological coping in response to exposure to repeated stress, need to be investigated more extensively. In the present study, twenty healthy male subjects were each exposed twice to the same psychosocial stressor (Stroop Color Word Interference task, public speaking and mental arithmetic in front of an audience) during a first session (day 1) and a second session (day 8). Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT) and prolactin (PRL) were measured immediately before the beginning of the tests and at their end, 30 min later, on both experimental days. For the total group, NE, EPI, ACTH, and CORT levels were significantly elevated, and PRL levels were significantly decreased, after stress exposure on day 1. ACTH and CORT levels showed less significant increases after stress on day 8. In contrast, NE and EPI responses to stress were not significantly blunted, and PRL response was unchanged on day 8. Cluster analysis revealed two groups of subjects who showed different habituation patterns for ACTH and CORT. The first group (n=12) of subjects showed a reduction of ACTH and CORT responses to stress on day 8. The subjects of the second group (n=8) displayed a significant increase of ACTH and cortisol in response to stress on day 8, without any habituation effect. These results increase the evidence concerning the involvement of the HPA axis and catecholamines in response to psychological stress, and suggest that possible individual differences in the neuroendocrine coping mechanisms may affect mood regulation and the state of health.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cancer-related distress due to the psychological and physical challenges of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) may result in symptoms of depression, which negatively affects quality and may influence quantity of life. This study investigated how depression affects MBC stress reactivity, including autonomic (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. METHOD: Forty-five nondepressed and 45 depressed patients with MBC underwent a modified Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) while affect, cardiovascular, respiratory, and cortisol responses were measured. RESULTS: At study entry, depressed compared with nondepressed patients had significantly lower log cortisol waking rise levels (p = .005) but no other HPA differences. Positive affect (p = .025) and high-frequency heart-rate variability (lnHF) (p = .002) were significantly lower at TSST baseline in depressed patients. In response to the TSST, depressed patients reported significantly lower positive (p = .050) and greater negative affect (p = .037) and had significantly reduced lnHF (p = .031). In secondary analyses, at TSST baseline both low-frequency (lnLF) (p = .002) and very-low-frequency (lnVLF) (p = .0001) heart rate variability were significantly lower in the depressed group. In secondary analyses during the TSST, those who were depressed had significantly lower lnVLF (p = .008) and did not increase aortic impedance reactivity as much as did the nondepressed during the stressor (p = .005). CONCLUSION: Depression in patients with MBC was associated with alterations in autonomic regulation, particularly reductions in respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a measure of cardiac vagal control, at baseline and during the TSST. In addition, depression was associated with blunted HPA response to awakening. Both MBC groups had relative cortisol hyporesponsiveness to acute stress.},

Data are collected through a peer referral process over social networks. RDS has proven practical for data collection in many difficult settings and has been adopted by leading public health organizations around the world. Unfortunately, inference from RDS data requires many strong assumptions because the sampling design is partially beyond the control of the researcher and not fully observable. We introduce diagnostic tools for most of these assumptions and apply them in 12 high risk populations. These diagnostics empower researchers to understand their RDS data better and encourage future statistical research on RDS sampling and inference.},

Previous treatments of this process have used a with-replacement approximation, which we show induces bias in estimates for large sample fractions and differential network connectedness by characteristic of interest. We present a treatment of respondent-driven sampling as a successive sampling process. Unlike existing representations, our approach respects the essential without-replacement feature of the process, while converging to an existing with-replacement representation for small sample fractions, and to the sample mean for a full-population sample. We present a successive-sampling based estimator for population means based on respondent-driven sampling data, and demonstrate its superior performance when the size of the hidden population is known. We present sensitivity analyses for unknown population sizes. In addition, we note that like other existing estimators, our new estimator is subject to bias induced by the selection of the initial sample. Using data collected among three populations in two countries, we illustrate the application of this approach to populations with varying characteristics. We conclude that the successive sampling estimator improves on existing estimators, and can also be used as a diagnostic tool when population size is not known.

As an alternative, we introduce a modelassisted approach, resulting in a design-based estimator leveraging a working network model. We derive a new class of estimators for population means and a corresponding bootstrap standard error estimator.We demonstrate improved performance compared with existing estimators, including adjustment for an initial convenience sample. We also apply the method and an extension to the estimation of the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in a high-risk population.},

Accurate epidemiological studies are often logistically and financially difficult, but processes of rural\textendash urban migration and epidemiological transition are certainly increasing the prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Type 1 disease is relatively rare, although this may be related to high mortality. This diabetic subgroup appears to present at a later age (by about a decade) than in Western countries. Variant forms of diabetes are also described in the continent; notably `atypical, ketosis-prone' diabetes, and malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus. These types sometimes make the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes difficult. Interestingly, this is also a current experience in the developed world. As more detailed and reliable complication studies emerge, it is increasingly apparent that African diabetes is associated with a high complication burden, which is both difficult to treat and prevent. More optimistically, a number of intervention studies and twinning projects are showing real benefits in varying locations. Future improvements depend on practical and sustainable support, coupled with local acceptance of diabetes as a major threat to the future health and quality of life of sub-Saharan Africans.},

Objective: To test the null hypothesis that ethnicity is unrelated to bias of mean body mass index (BMI) and to sensitivity of overweight or obesity (BMI {$>$}= 25 kg/m2) derived from self-reported (SR) versus measured weight and height using measured BMI as the gold standard. Design: Cross-sectional survey of a large national sample, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) conducted in 1988\textendash 1994. Participants: American men and women aged 20 years and over (n = 15,025). Measurements: SR height, weight, cigarette smoking, health status, and socio-demographic variables from home interview and measured weight and height. Results: In women and Mexican American (MA) men SR BMI underestimated true prevalence rates of overweight or obesity. For other men, no consistent difference was seen. Sensitivity of SR was similar in non-Hispanic European Americans (EA) and non-Hispanic African Americans (AA) but much lower in MA. Prevalence of obesity (BMI {$>$}= 30 kg/m2) is consistently underestimated by self-report, the gap being greater for MA than for other women, but similar for MA and other men. The mean difference between self-reported and measured BMI was greater in MA (men -0.37, women -0.76 kg/m2) than in non-Hispanic EA (men -0.22, women -0.62 kg/m2). In a regression model with the difference between self-reported and measured BMI as the dependent variable, MA ethnicity was a significant (p {$<$} 0.01) predictor of the difference in men and in women. The effect of MA ethnicity could not be explained by socio-demographic variables, smoking or health status. Conclusion: Under-estimation of the prevalence of overweight or obesity based on height and weight self-reported at interview varied significantly among ethnic groups independent of other variables.},

The MCS-12 performed better than the GHQ-12, and equally to the K6 for diagnoses of depression, though not anxiety disorders, where the K6 showed greater utility. The K10 out-performed the MCS-12 for all diagnoses.

Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the American Medical Association's 2008 Physician Masterfile, which includes data on all physicians who have ever obtained a medical license in at least 1 US state. We restricted the analysis to physicians who completed emergency medicine residency training or who obtained emergency medicine board certification. We defined attrition as not being active in emergency medicine clinical practice. Attrition was reported as cumulative and annualized rates, with stratification by years since training graduation. Death rates were estimated from life tables for the US population. Results Of the 30,864 emergency medicine\textendash trained or emergency medicine board-certified physicians, 26,826 (87\%) remain active in emergency medicine clinical practice. Overall, type of attrition was 45\% to non\textendash emergency medicine clinical practice, 22\% retired, 14\% administration, and 10\% research/teaching. Immediate attrition ({$<$}2 years since training graduation) was 6.5\%. The cumulative attrition rates from 2 to 15 years postgraduation were stable (5\% to 9\%) and thereafter were progressively higher, with 18\% having left emergency medicine clinical practice at 20 years postgraduation and 25\% at 30 years postgraduation. Annualized attrition rates were highest for the first 5 years postgraduation and after 40 years postgraduation; between 5 and 40 years, the rates remained low ({$<$}1\%). The overall annual attrition rate from emergency medicine clinical practice, including estimated death rate, was approximately 1.7\%. Conclusion Despite the high stress and demands of emergency medicine, overall attrition remains low and compares favorably with that of other medical specialties. These data have positive implications for the emergency physician workforce and are important for accurate estimation of and planning for emergency physician workforce needs.},

By the middle of adolescence and continuing at least until age 55, females are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression and exhibit twice as many depressive symptoms as males. Researchers have recently begun to propose models that specify complicated relationships among variables to explain the gender difference in depression and why it emerges in adolescence. These models need to be tested empirically and new models need to be formulated based on the data that emerge. Additionally, research is needed to explore whether there are gender differences in the chronicity and recurrence of depression as well as in initial episodes and whether the models that explain the gender difference in depression during adolescence also explain the continuing gender difference in young and middle-aged adults.},

We find important differences between and among racial/ethnic groups in terms of the mechanisms that shape board appointments. Consistent with the ethnic matching perspective, we find that the representation of Black and Hispanic board directors is strongly predicted by the racial/ethnic composition of the industry's labor force. Contrary to the visibility threat perspective, however, we find that the appointment of Asian directors is strongly predicted by the ethnic composition of the community where the firm is located.},

In particular, those recipients showing greater benefits on closeness tended to show lesser cost on negative mood, and vice versa. Self-esteem was examined as a possible moderator of support effects, but its role was evident in only a subset of recipients.

Values of body fat (BF) and maximum oxygen intake (VO2 max) expressed as percentiles of appropriate age and sex categories were used as criteria of validity for the questionnaire. BF and VO2 max were predicted from the Durnin and Womersley skinfold equations, and the laboratory version of the Canadian Home Fitness Test respectively. The strongest correlation was between VO2 max (percentile) and reported strenuous exercise (r = 0.35). The optimum discriminant function for VO2 max was based on a combination of reported strenuous and light activity. This yielded a correct 2-way classification of 69\% of the subjects. A combination of sweat-inducing and moderate exercise yielded a correct 2-way classification of BF for 66\% of subjects. The reliability coefficients for the optimum discriminant functions classifying VO2 max and BF were 0.83 and 0.85 respectively. We conclude that this simple instrument has potential value for the assessment of leisure time exercise behavior, offering the possibility of examining changes in behavior following the implementation of health and physical fitness promotion programmes in the community.},

Two models which predict alternative hypotheses were evaluated. 1) Based on the selfmedication model, it was hypothesized that social support would aid in coping with painful affect and decrease the need for drugs. 2) Based on a social learning model, it was hypothesized that drug use in the social network would threaten abstinence due to modeling and conditioning effects. Method: Seventy methadone maintenance patients were given baseline measures of mood, stress, social support, and drug use in the network and followed prospectively for 3 months with weekly urine drug screens. Results: Social support was correlated with positive affect (r = .59, p {$<$} .001), and stress with negative affect (r = .46, p {$<$} .001), but no measures of social support, affect, or stress correlated with the proportion of drug positive urines. However, patients with at least one drug user among the closest significant others had 63 {$\pm$} 3 8 \% positive urines versus 35 {$\pm$} 36\% positive among those without a dmg-using significant other \{t = - 3 . 2 , p {$<$} .002). Conclusions: Substance use in the social network had a substantial negative impact on treatment outcome. Consistent with the social learning model and the traditional "persons, places, and things," this suggests interventions should get drugusing significant others into treatment and teach patients coping skills to reduce their negative influence.\vphantom\}},

To examine the effect of HRV biofeedback on symptoms of anxiety and stress, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. Methods. The search identified 24 studies totaling 484 participants who received HRV biofeedback training for stress and anxiety. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. Results. The pre-post within-group effect size (Hedges' g) was 0.81. The between-groups analysis comparing biofeedback to a control condition yielded Hedges' g = 0.83. Moderator analyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by study year, risk of study bias, percentage of females, number of sessions, or presence of an anxiety disorder. Conclusions. HRV biofeedback training is associated with a large reduction in self-reported stress and anxiety. Although more well-controlled studies are needed, this intervention offers a promising approach for treating stress and anxiety with wearable devices.},

In addition, we identify possible moderators of these associations and summarize plausible underlying biobehavioral pathways. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science searches were conducted using the keywords metabolic syndrome, syndrome x, central adiposity=obesity, visceral adiposity=obesity, body fat distribution, waist circumference, waist hip ratio, insulin resistance=sensitivity, glucose tolerance, psychological, depression, hostility, anger, cynicism, and anxiety. Results: The current literature provides cross-sectional evidence for an association between psychological characteristics and the metabolic syndrome. Prospective data, though limited, suggest that depression, hostility, and anger predict increased risk for the metabolic syndrome. Data on modifiers are too limited to permit definitive conclusions. Negative health behaviors and hypothalamic and sympathetic dysregulation are identified as plausible underlying pathways. Conclusions: More prospective studies, conducted with diverse samples, are needed to delineate the direction of this relationship and the proposed biobehavioral mechanisms; experimental investigations are needed to test for causality. Nevertheless, findings suggest that psychological characteristics, especially depression, hostility, and anger, may increase risk for the metabolic syndrome, providing a novel direction for prevention and treatment interventions.},

Methods\textemdash Data were drawn from one of seven sites of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a prospective cohort study of the menopausal transition. Participants were 429 (34.5\% African-American) women. Major depression and comorbid diagnoses were assessed via the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition Axis I Disorders at baseline and seven annual follow-up evaluations. The metabolic syndrome was measured at baseline and each follow-up evaluation (except the second) based on National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria. Results\textemdash Longitudinal generalized estimating equations (GEE) models indicated that, in women who were free of the metabolic syndrome at baseline, a lifetime major depression history or current major depressive episode at baseline was significantly associated with the onset and presence of the metabolic syndrome during the follow-up (odds ratio = 1.82; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.06\textendash 3.14). Survival analyses showed that, in women who were free of the metabolic syndrome at baseline, a lifetime major depression history or current major depressive episode at baseline predicted increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome during the follow-up (hazard ratio = 1.66; 95\% CI = 0.99\textendash 3.75). Lifetime history of alcohol abuse or dependence predicted incident metabolic syndrome and attenuated the association between depression and the metabolic syndrome in both models. Conclusions\textemdash This study documents that major depression is a significant predictor of the onset of the metabolic syndrome. Intervention studies targeting depression may prevent the development of the metabolic syndrome in women.},

These trends include the rapidly growing population of older adults, the increasing life expectancy associated with advances in public health and clinical medicine, the persistently high prevalence of some risk factors, and the emerging high prevalence of multiple chronic conditions. Although preventing and mitigating the effect of chronic conditions requires sufficient measurement capacities, such measurement has been constrained by lack of consistency in definitions and diagnostic classification schemes and by heterogeneity in data systems and methods of data collection. We outline a conceptual model for improving understanding of and standardizing approaches to defining, identifying, and using information about chronic conditions in the United States. We illustrate this model's operation by applying a standard classification scheme for chronic conditions to 5 national-level data systems.},

  abstract = {Objective To test the fit and stability of 3 alternative models of the metabolic syndrome's factor structure across 3 developmental stages. Study design With data from the Fels Longitudinal Study, confirmatory factor analyses tested 3 alternative models of the factor structure underlying relationships among 8 metabolic syndrome-associated risks. Models tested were a 1-factor model (A), a 4-factor model (B), and a second-order latent factor model (C). Developmental stages assessed were prepuberty (ages 8-10), puberty (ages 11-15), and postpuberty (ages 16-20). Results Convergence was achieved for all developmental stages for model A, but the fit was poor throughout (root mean square error of approximation {$>$} 0.1). Standardized factor loadings for waist circumference and body mass index were much stronger than those for fasting insulin at all 3 time points. Although prepuberty and postpuberty models converged for models B and C, each model had problems with Heywood cases. The puberty model did not converge for either model B or C. Conclusions The hypothetical structures commonly used to support the metabolic syndrome concept do not provide adequate fit in a pediatric sample and may be variable by maturation stage. A components-based approach to cardiovascular risk reduction, with emphasis on obesity prevention and control, may be a more appropriate clinical strategy for children and youth than a syndromic approach.

  abstract = {Obesity is a rapidly increasing public health problem, with surveillance most often based on self-reported values of height and weight. We conducted a systematic review to determine what empirical evidence exists regarding the agreement between objective (measured) and subjective (reported) measures in assessing height, weight and body mass index (BMI). Five electronic databases were searched to identify observational and experimental studies on adult populations over the age of 18. Searching identified 64 citations that met the eligibility criteria and examined the relationship between self-reported and directly measured height or weight. Overall, the data show trends of under-reporting for weight and BMI and over-reporting for height, although the degree of the trend varies for men and women and the characteristics of the population being examined. Standard deviations were large indicating that there is a great deal of individual variability in reporting of results. Combining the results quantitatively was not possible because of the poor reporting of outcomes of interest. Accurate estimation of these variables is important as data from population studies such as those included in this review are often used to generate regional and national estimates of overweight and obesity and are in turn used by decision makers to allocate resources and set priorities in health.},

All these changes combined generate a 106\% rise in net tuition between 1987 and 2010, which more than accounts for the 78\% increase seen in the data. Changes in the FSLP alone generate a 102\% tuition increase, and changes in the college premium generate a 24\% increase.

Both were analyzed using principal components analysis and the Mokken scaling procedure. The latter technique examines whether items can be described as having a hierarchical structure. The results across techniques were comparable and hierarchical structures were discovered in the scales. Analysis of the hierarchy in the RII items suggested the latent trait assesses the extent to which an individual's belief in God influences their life. Examining scales with a range of psychometric techniques may give a better indication of the latent construct being assessed, particularly the hierarchies within these which may be of interest to those investigating religiosity-health associations.},

The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

Both draw upon theological resources, and this commentary article examines their theological assumptions and suggests additional theological resources that may extend their research and strengthen the interdisciplinary value of their approaches. In particular, grace and virtue historically share a dependence upon the embodied dispositions of habitus that could benefit from further contemporary study and may illuminate new insights into mutually supportive development of virtue and embodiment of grace. Grace and virtue have centuries-old, complex scholarly history with numerous well-reasoned contributions, some of which may better cohere with contemporary psychological findings than those views more recently popularized within the American Protestant traditions upon which the authors draw. Not only does a Roman Catholic understanding of grace undergird the faith tradition of the majority of the world's Christians but its nuanced view of grace's structuring of a person's habitus directly connects to a common understanding of virtue as disposition. An Eastern Orthodox process of spiritual formation, due to Irenaeus, has dispositional, mediating, and telic dimensions similar to virtue that may correlate with Schnitker et al.'s personality model of virtue, which thus suggests a possible psychological model of personality development that might support both virtue development and spiritual formation.},

  abstract = {Orphans and separated children (OSC) are a vulnerable population whose numbers are increasing, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Over 153 million children worldwide have lost one or both parents, including 17 million orphaned by AIDS, and millions more have been separated from their parents. As younger orphans enter adolescence, their sexual health and HIV-related risk behaviors become key considerations for their overall health. Importantly, their high prevalence of exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) may put OSC at additional risk for adverse sexual health outcomes. The Positive Outcomes for Orphans study followed OSC randomly sampled from institution-based care and from family-based care, as well as a convenience sample of non-OSC, at six sites in five low-and middle-income countries. This analysis focused on the 90-month follow-up, during which adolescents 16 and older were assessed for sexual health, including age at sexual debut, past-year sex, past-year condom use, and perceptions of condom use. We specifically examined the relationship between PTEs and sexual health outcomes. Of the 1258 OSC and 138 non-OSC assessed, 11\% reported ever having sex. Approximately 6\% of participants reported recent sex and 5\% reported having recent unprotected sex. However, 70\% of those who had recent sex reported that they did not use a condom every time, and perceptions of condom use tended to be unfavorable for protection against sexual risk behavior. Nearly all (90\%) of participants reported experiencing at least one lifetime PTE. For those who experienced ``any'' PTE, we found increased prevalence of recent sex (PR\,=\,1.39 [0.47, 4.07]) and of recent unprotected sex (PR\,=\,3.47 [0.60, 19.91]). This study highlights the need for caregivers, program managers, and policymakers to promote condom use for sexually active OSC and identify interventions for trauma support services. Orphans living in family-based care may also be particularly vulnerable to early sexual debut and unprotected sexual activity.},

  abstract = {Background: Policy makers struggling to protect the 153 million orphaned and separated children (OSC) worldwide need evidence-based research on the burden of potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and the relative risk of PTEs across different types of care settings. Methods: The Positive Outcomes for Orphans study used a 2-stage, cluster-randomized sampling design to identify 1,357 institution-dwelling and 1,480 family-dwelling orphaned and separated children in 5 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. We used the Life Events Checklist developed by the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder to examine self-reported PTEs among 2,235 OSC ages 10\textendash 13 at baseline. We estimated prevalence and incidence during 36-months of follow-up and compared the risk of PTEs across care settings. Data collection began between May 2006 and February 2008, depending on the site. Results: Lifetime prevalence by age 13 of any PTE, excluding loss of a parent, was 91.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 85.6, 94.5) in institution-dwelling OSC and 92.4\% (95\% CI = 90.3, 94.0) in family-dwelling OSC; annual incidence of any PTE was lower in institution-dwelling (23.6\% [95\% CI = 19.4, 28.7]) than family-dwelling OSC (30.0\% [95\% CI = 28.1, 32.2]). More than half of children in institutions (50.3\% [95\% CI = 42.5, 58.0]) and in family-based care (54.0\% [95\% CI = 50.2, 57.7]) had experienced physical or sexual abuse by age 13. Annual incidence of physical or sexual abuse was lower in institution-dwelling (12.9\% [95\% CI = 9.6, 17.3]) than family-dwelling OSC (19.4\% [95\% CI = 17.7, 21.3]), indicating statistically lower risk in institution-dwelling OSC (risk difference = 6.5\% [95\% CI = 1.4, 11.7]). Conclusion: Prevalence and incidence of PTEs were high among OSC, but contrary to common assumptions, OSC living in institutions did not report more PTEs or more abuse than OSC living with families. Current efforts to reduce the number of institution-dwelling OSC may not reduce incidence of PTEs in this vulnerable population. Protection of children from PTEs should be a primary consideration, regardless of the care setting.},

With mass rape and systematic sexual violence becoming an increasingly prevalent weapon of warfare, the international community has created special international criminal tribunals and courts to address crimes as such: war crimes, crimes against humanity, and even genocide. This paper aims to trace the developments in international criminal law and procedure for the prosecution of sexual violence from Nuremberg and Tokyo to Kigali and The Hague while also identifying shortcomings and potential reforms. As the International Criminal Court hears landmark evidence and testimony on charges of rape in the case of Jean-Pierre Bemba, local and national courts in the Congo still fail to deliver the more "nationalized" justice that rape victims seek and prefer. This paper, using sexual violence and conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a case study, highlights the often underestimated importance of strengthening local and national judiciaries through legal and judicial reform as well as the critical role that international courts must play in sharing information, expertise, and prosecution strategies, especially on cases of sexual violence.},

  abstract = {For several years now, the Roman Catholic Church and the institution of the priesthood itself have been at the center of a firestorm of controversy. While many of the criticisms lodged against the recent actions of the Church\textemdash and a small number of its priests\textemdash are justified, the majority of these criticisms are not. Hyperbolic and misleading coverage of recent scandals has created a public image of American priests that bears little relation to reality, and Andrew Greeley's Priests skewers this image with a systematic inside look at American priests today.  No stranger to controversy himself, Greeley here challenges those analysts and the media who parrot them in placing the blame for recent Church scandals on the mandate of celibacy or a clerical culture that supports homosexuality. Drawing upon reliable national survey samples of priests, Greeley demolishes current stereotypes about the percentage of homosexual priests, the level of personal and professional happiness among priests, the role of celibacy in their lives, and many other issues. His findings are more than surprising: they reveal, among other things, that priests report higher levels of personal and professional satisfaction than doctors, lawyers, or faculty members; that they would overwhelmingly choose to become priests again; and that younger priests are far more conservative than their older brethren.  While the picture Greeley paints should radically reorient the public perception of priests, he does not hesitate to criticize the Church's significant shortcomings. Most priests, for example, do not think the sexual abuse problems are serious, and they do not think that poor preaching or liturgy is a problem, though the laity give them very low marks on their ministerial skills. Priests do not listen to the laity, bishops do not listen to priests, and the Vatican does not listen to any of them. With Greeley's statistical evidence and provocative recommendations for change\textemdash including a national "Priest Corps" that would offer young men a limited term of service in the Church\textemdash Priests offers a new vision for American Catholics, one based on real problems and solutions rather than on images of a depraved, immature, and frustrated priesthood.},

  abstract = {This article summarizes the first documented quantitative national estimates of the economic value of religion to U.S. society. Specifically, the study provides conservative, mid-range, and high estimates. The study's most conservative estimate, which takes into account only the revenues of faith-based organizations, is \$378 billion annually \textendash{} or more than a third of a trillion dollars. By way of economic perspective, this is more than the global annual revenues of tech giants Apple and Microsoft combined. While this first estimate has the most concrete data, we believe that it is certainly an undervaluation because it focuses on annual revenues rather than on the fair market value of the goods and services religious organizations provide. Our second mid-range estimate attempts to correct for this in two ways: by providing an estimate of the fair market value of goods and services provided by religious organizations, and by including the contribution of businesses with religious roots. This mid-range estimate puts the value of religion to U.S. society at over \$1 trillion annually. Our third, higher-end estimate recognizes that people of faith conduct their affairs to some extent (however imperfectly) inspired and guided by their faith ideals. This higher-end estimate is based on the household incomes of religiously affiliated Americans, and places the value of faith to U.S. society at \$4.8 trillion annually, or the equivalent of nearly a third of America's gross domestic product (GDP). Finally, we discuss the limitations of this study and suggest several possible lines of research that could build upon and extend this research.},

One body of research suggests that clergy, among others, burn out because of the systems in which they work. From this perspective, burnout is the result of external systemic factors such as bureaucracy, poor administrative support, and difficult work conditions. The other body of research suggests that burnout is the result of intrapersonal factors such as high idealism, Type-A personality, narcissism, and perfectionism. It is our position that these two bodies of research are compatible, and that by integrating the Self psychology of Kohut with the general systems theory of Bowen, it becomes easier to understand burnout. Further, by integrating these two theories, principles for treatment become clearer. \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Clin Psychol/In Session 56: 619\textendash 632, 2000.},

  abstract = {Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, or high-frequency heart-rate variability) is frequently employed as an index of cardiac vagal tone or even believed to be a direct measure of vagal tone. However, there are many significant caveats regarding vagal tone interpretation:1.Respiratory parameters can confound relations between RSA and cardiac vagal tone.2.Although intraindividual relations between RSA and cardiac vagal control are often strong, interindividual associations may be modest.3.RSA measurement is profoundly influenced by concurrent levels of momentary physical activity, which can bias estimation of individual differences in vagal tone.4.RSA magnitude is affected by beta-adrenergic tone.5.RSA and cardiac vagal tone can dissociate under certain circumstances.6.The polyvagal theory contains evolution-based speculations that relate RSA, vagal tone and behavioral phenomena. We present evidence that the polyvagal theory does not accurately depict evolution of vagal control of heart-rate variability, and that it ignores the phenomenon of cardiac aliasing and disregards the evolution of a functional role for vagal control of the heart, from cardiorespiratory synchrony in fish to RSA in mammals. Unawareness of these issues can lead to misinterpretation of cardiovascular autonomic mechanisms. On the other hand, RSA has been shown to often provide a reasonable reflection of cardiac vagal tone when the above-mentioned complexities are considered. Finally, a recent hypothesis is expanded upon, in which RSA plays a primary role in regulation of energy exchange by means of synchronizing respiratory and cardiovascular processes during metabolic and behavioral change.},

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), the authors find evidence supporting the depressive contagion thesis. This effect is observed above and beyond key social relationship and sociodemographic controls. To examine the role of social context in moderating the effect of depressive contagion, the authors utilize a longitudinal mixed effects model using Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the Add Health survey. The results reveal that depressive contagion is more salient for adolescents who are embedded in dense peer networks and attend schools with high network density and mutuality. Furthermore, popular students, measured as the number of received friendship nominations, are more vulnerable to depressive contagion. Overall, the findings in this study demonstrate a differential vulnerability to depressive contagion dependent on microsocial and macrosocial context.},

Methods We conducted a literature search of studies reporting the age-specific prevalence for diabetes and used the Analytic Hierarchy Process to systematically select studies to generate estimates for 219 countries and territories. Estimates for countries without available source data were modelled from pooled estimates of countries that were similar in regard to geography, ethnicity, and economic development. Logistic regression was applied to generate smoothed age-specific prevalence estimates for adults 20\textendash 79 years which were then applied to population estimates for 2013 and 2035. Results A total of 744 data sources were considered and 174 included, representing 130 countries. In 2013, 382 million people had diabetes; this number is expected to rise to 592 million by 2035. Most people with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries and these will experience the greatest increase in cases of diabetes over the next 22 years. Conclusion The new estimates of diabetes in adults confirm the large burden of diabetes, especially in developing countries. Estimates will be updated annually including the most recent, high-quality data available.},

  abstract = {A theoretical model of managerial careers is presented which links two organizational characteristics (structure and growth) to the pattern of managerial careers within an organization. Different combinations of these characteristics give rise to different organizational career logics (OCLs), which are the rationalities an observer imputes to the pattern of work role transitions within a firm. Each OCL is associated with its own distinctive pattern of work role transition, and a framework for classifying these transitions is described which allows the differences to be made manifest. Three ideal-type OCLs are described, and the perspective is illustrated by reference to work role transition patterns in four large British manufacturing firms. Additional sources of variance are discussed: some are predicted by the OCL perspective and some arise as the result of choices made by individual managers within the overall framework of their firm's OCL. A simple two-dimensional model of individual choice is presented. Each OCL and its associated pattern of transitions is also likely to develop different skills and expertise in its managers; the paper concludes by discussing what these different forms of expertise might be.},

This article examines the partisan identifications and electoral behavior of American Protestant clergy in the 2016 presidential election. Although clergy partisanship may be of interest in any election, the 2016 contest, given the milieu of political polarization and the presence of the Trump candidacy, provides an intriguing context for assessing the profession's electoral behavior, particularly among Republican clergy. Based on survey results from over 2,500 clergy drawn from ten Protestant (five mainline and five evangelical) denominations, the study finds that, during the early stages of the 2016 nomination process, only a small percentage of Republican clergy supported Trump and that, despite the high level of political polarization, a sizable segment of Republican clergy resisted partisan pressures and refused to vote for Trump in the general election. The propensity of both independent and Republican clergy to vote for the GOP nominee varied largely with the level of perceived ``threats'': to the Christian heritage of the nation, from Islam, and from the process of ``globalization.''},

  abstract = {The problem of declining membership in Germany's churches has been apparent for almost half a century. However, few scientific studies have investigated the respective influences of demographic and church-specific phenomena, as well as the potential impact if present trends continue. To answer these questions, we use a cohort component model and project the membership of each German Catholic diocese and Protestant regional church until 2060. Thus, for the first time we present a projection of church members for each of the 27 Catholic (arch-) dioceses and the 20 Protestant regional churches, as well as for the entire Evangelical Church and the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. We collected data from dioceses, Protestant regional churches and the Federal Statistical Office. Under the assumptions made, the results suggest a continued decline in membership and that by 2060 the number of church members would be half the number of 2017. Protestant Church membership would have shrunk slightly more than Catholic Church membership. We can conclude that church-specific factors (baptisms, leaving, and joining the church) would have a stronger influence on declining numbers than demographic factors. Moreover, demographic change would have a greater impact on registered church membership than on the total population. The proportion of Christians in the population would sharply decrease. Although in 2017 54.4\,percent of the population belonged to one of the two major churches, according to the projection model, only 31.1\,percent would be church members in 2060. As our results are not predictions but projections using trend analysis, we show how changed conditions would affect the projected development in five scenarios.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burnout and work engagement have been viewed as opposite, yet distinct states of employee well-being. We investigated whether work-related indicators of well-being (i.e. burnout and work engagement) spill-over and generalize to context-free well-being (i.e. depressive symptoms and life satisfaction). More specifically, we examined the causal direction: does burnout/work engagement lead to depressive symptoms/life satisfaction, or the other way around? METHODS: Three surveys were conducted. In 2003, 71\% of all Finnish dentists were surveyed (n=3255), and the response rate of the 3-year follow-up was 84\% (n=2555). The second follow-up was conducted four years later with a response rate of 86\% (n=1964). Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the cross-lagged associations between the study variables across time. RESULTS: Burnout predicted depressive symptoms and life dissatisfaction from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3. Conversely, work engagement had a negative effect on depressive symptoms and a positive effect on life satisfaction, both from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3, even after adjusting for the impact of burnout at every occasion. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted among one occupational group, which limits its generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Work-related well-being predicts general wellbeing in the long-term. For example, burnout predicts depressive symptoms and not vice versa. In addition, burnout and work engagement are not direct opposites. Instead, both have unique, incremental impacts on life satisfaction and depressive symptoms.},

The second aim was to investigate whether home resources and home demands have an additional influence on both processes over time. The hypotheses were tested with cross-lagged analyses based on two waves over a three-year period. The results supported both the motivational process and the health impairment process. Job resources influenced future work engagement, which, in turn, predicted organizational commitment, whereas job demands predicted burnout over time, which, in turn, predicted future depression. In addition, job resources had a weak negative impact on burnout. Home demands and home resources did not influence the motivational or health impairment process over time. The results support the central role of work characteristics for health and well-being. By integrating both human thriving and ill-health in the same model, the JD-R model may help to bridge the gap between ``negative'' and ``positive'' psychology.},

Using linked CPS records for household heads first interviewed between January 2007 and June 2010, our analyses are based on strategic within-person comparisons across survey months and between-person comparisons across CPS rotation groups. We find considerable evidence for panel conditioning effects in the CPS. Panel conditioning downwardly biases the CPS-based unemployment rate, mainly by leading people to remove themselves from its denominator. Across surveys, CPS respondents (claim to) leave the labor force in greater numbers than otherwise equivalent respondents who are participating in the CPS for the first time. The results cannot be attributed to panel attrition or mode effects. We discuss implications for CPS-based research and policy as well as for survey methodology more broadly.},

However, little information is available for assessing the complex associations among being overweight or obese with neighborhood and individual sociodemographic factors and the measured and perceived community food environment. Methods: Using 2014 national evaluation data from 20 communities (analyzed 2015\textendash 2016) that participated in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Community Transformation Grants Program, we used multilevel multivariable models to assess associations among factors at the individual, census tract, and county levels with being overweight or obese and with the perceived home food environment. Results: Individual level factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and education) were significantly associated with the likelihood of being overweight or obese in every model tested. Census tract level poverty and education were significantly associated with the likelihood of being overweight or obese in univariate but not multivariable analyses. Perceived community food environment was a significant predictor of the perceived home food environment; the objective measure of county-level grocery store access was not. Neither perceived nor objective community food environment measures were significantly associated with overweight/obesity in multivariable analyses. Conclusion: Individual-level sociodemographic characteristics are more strongly associated with obesity-related outcomes than are area-level measures. Future interventions designed to address health equity issues in obesity among underserved populations may benefit from focusing on nutrition education tailored to individuals, to encourage purchase and consumption of healthy food. Improving healthy food availability in underserved communities may also be critical for nutrition education to have a meaningful impact.},

The current article, however, shows that if stability of constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, time-invariant nature, the autoregressive relationships of the CLPM fail to adequately account for this. As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the CLPM do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.

Using an employer\textendash employee matched data set of nursing homes linked to a federal regulatory database and a resident survey, we found that ownership moderates the relationship between wage inequality and service quality. Although wage inequality positively affects service quality in the for-profit sector, the reverse is true among nonprofit organizations. We also found that overall wage inequality in the workplace has a more pronounced influence on employee discretionary effort than does the employee's place in the distribution of wages.},

  abstract = {Since its inception in the 1960s, research on premature (i.e., pre-retirement) clergy attrition from congregational ministry has focused on identifying the factors that precipitate and mitigate ministry exits, while the rates at which clergy leave the ministry have been inconsistently tracked. The literature on clergy attrition is peppered with claims of alarmingly high rates of departure; however, these studies lack strong empirical support. The evidence, while fragmentary, consistently shows that pastors do not leave congregational ministry in large numbers. Incidence of attrition of about 1\%\textendash 2\% per year is typical across Protestant denominations and among Roman Catholic priests. In addition, contrary to popular conceptions, there is little evidence attrition is particularly high in the first 5\,years of congregational ministry. In terms of the reasons for leaving, among Protestants, the most common factor named is conflict with the congregation or denominational system; a smaller number leave to pursue personal goals or to care for family. Among Catholics, loneliness and isolation, tied in major part to the celibacy requirement, are the most significant reasons cited for leaving. Finances or a loss of faith are rarely cited as reasons for leaving among either Catholics or Protestants.},

  abstract = {Automatic estimation of demographic attributes (e.g., age, gender, and race) from a face image is a topic of growing interest with many potential applications. Most prior work on this topic has used face images acquired under constrained and cooperative scenarios. This paper addresses the more challenging problem of automatic age, gender, and race estimation from real-life face images (face images in the wild) acquired in unconstrained conditions. Given an input face image, we first normalize it by performing pose and photometric corrections. Biologically inspired features (BIF) are then extracted from the normalized face image, including both the central face region and the surrounding context region. Given this representation, three different Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to predict the age group (or exact age), gender, and race of a subject. Experimental results on two large public-domain unconstrained face databases (Images of Groups and LFW) show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art methods. Our results also highlight that extraction of demographic attributes from face images in the wild is a difficult problem.},

Emphasis is placed on point estimation using the posterior mean, which facilitates prediction of future observations via the posterior predictive distribution. It is shown that the standard lasso prediction method does not necessarily agree with model-based, Bayesian predictions. A new Gibbs sampler for Bayesian lasso regression is introduced.},

Specifically, we tested a mediation model linking religiosity to outcomes via chastity values (beliefs about the importance of waiting until marriage to have sex and importance of sex within marriage as a bonding experience). This model was tested with a sample of single young adults (4,188) and a sample of married adults (2,531). Among single young adults, religiosity positively predicted abstinence beliefs, and abstinence beliefs negatively predicted unhappiness, risk taking, and risky sex. Among married adults, religiosity positively predicted both chastity values (i.e., importance of waiting until marriage to have sex and importance of sex within marriage as a bonding experience), while, in turn, both chastity values were positively linked to sexual frequency and sexual satisfaction, but only belief in marital sex as bonding was positively related to sexual satisfaction. Differences across religious affiliation were also discussed (comparing Catholics, Protestants, Latter-Day Saints, and those with no religious affiliation). We conclude that one way religious communities may promote chastity and positive psychosocial functioning is by teaching chastity values and providing structures to motivate and enable people to live consistently with them.},

Skiing's hegemony of Whiteness is discussed in relation to parallel integration strategies of Black ski organizations, racialized representations of extreme skiing and snowboarding, and exclusionary residential development tactics. As a provisional effort to promote research on racism and leisure\textendash sports\textendash tourism, I argue that skiing offers a valuable site for considering the ongoing and overlooked saliencies of race and racial segregation in America.},

Religion is an important factor in accounting for both the similarities and differences between congregations but other factors also contribute to organizational issues which arise. It is suggested that congregations are 'special case' voluntary associations in which the actions of members are limited in ways which would not normally apply in secular associations. In addition to having associational features, congregations also have special organizational characteristics with respect to the role of ministers of religion and their 'ultimate goals'. The challenge for clergy, lay staff and lay members can be seen as one of operating the basic voluntary association model in a way that also takes into account the two special characteristics of congregational organization.},

Previous studies have tested this idea by comparing teacher turnover with that of similar professions, but have come to contradictory conclusions. We provide additional evidence by comparing teachers with professionals from other fields that are arguably comparable, namely nurses, social workers, and accountants. Using data from the Current Population Survey, the results suggest that the average rate of teacher turnover is not significantly higher than these professions, even after controlling for other measured differences among them. Where teacher turnover differs most from other professions is in the greater prevalence of turnover among older workers, likely reflecting earlier retirement. We find some evidence that the relatively high ratio of pensions-to-salaries in teaching partially explains this behavior. Other factors affecting turnover are also studied.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In-person interviews with a representative sample of US noninstitutionalized civilian adults (Ն18 years) (n = 36 309) who participated in the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III). Data were collected from April 2012 to June 2013 and were analyzed in 2016-2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of DSM-5 MDD and the DSM-5 specifiers. Odds ratios (ORs), adjusted ORs (aORs), and 95\% CIs indicated associations with demographic characteristics and other psychiatric disorders. RESULTS Of the 36 309 adult participants in NESARC-III, 12-month and lifetime prevalences of MDD were 10.4\% and 20.6\%, respectively. Odds of 12-month MDD were significantly lower in men (OR, 0.5; 95\% CI, 0.46-0.55) and in African American (OR, 0.6; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.68), Asian/Pacific Islander (OR, 0.6; 95\% CI, 0.45-0.67), and Hispanic (OR, 0.7; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.78) adults than in white adults and were higher in younger adults (age range, 18-29 years; OR, 3.0; 95\% CI, 2.48-3.55) and those with low incomes (\$19 999 or less; OR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.49-2.04). Associations of MDD with psychiatric disorders ranged from an aOR of 2.1 (95\% CI, 1.84-2.35) for specific phobia to an aOR of 5.7 (95\% CI, 4.98-6.50) for generalized anxiety disorder. Associations of MDD with substance use disorders ranged from an aOR of 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.63-2.01) for alcohol to an aOR of 3.0 (95\% CI, 2.57-3.55) for any drug. Most lifetime MDD cases were moderate (39.7\%) or severe (49.5\%). Almost 70\% with lifetime MDD had some type of treatment. Functioning among those with severe MDD was approximately 1 SD below the national mean. Among 12.9\% of those with lifetime MDD, all episodes occurred just after the death of someone close and lasted less than 2 months. The anxious/distressed specifier characterized 74.6\% of MDD cases, and the mixed-features specifier characterized 15.5\%. Controlling for severity, both specifiers were associated with early onset, poor course and functioning, and suicidality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among US adults, DSM-5 MDD is highly prevalent, comorbid, and disabling. While most cases received some treatment, a substantial minority did not. Much remains to be learned about the DSM-5 MDD specifiers in the general population.},

  abstract = {Social stressors that rely on the inclusion of confederates (i.e., Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) are often used in clinical laboratory research paradigms to elicit a measurable stress response in participants. Although effective, the TSST is labor intensive and may introduce error variance as a function of confederate race, gender, and/or response characteristics. The present study aimed to develop and validate an electronic version of the TSST (e-TSST). The primary aim was to compare the e-TSST to an e-neutral control condition; the exploratory aim was to compare the magnitude of stress response elicited by the e-TSST to that elicited by the traditional TSST. Forty-three healthy adults were randomized to the e-TSST or e-neutral condition. Subjective (participant-rated distress) and objective (cortisol, heart rate and blood pressure) indices of stress were collected prior to, and multiple times following, the stressor. Using archival data collected from 19 healthy participants exposed to the traditional TSST in a prior study, stress reactivity was compared between the electronic and traditional versions of the TSST. The e-TSST elicited significant increases in all measures of stress reactivity compared to the e-neutral condition, with the exception of heart rate (HR). Results showed that the magnitude of subjective distress, BP, and HR responses elicited by the e-TSST did not differ significantly from that elicited by the traditional TSST. The traditional TSST elicited significantly higher cortisol than the e-TSST. Although these findings provide initial support for the development of electronic versions of the TSST, further refinement of the e-TSST is warranted prior to broad adoption of this technology. A refined, reliable e-TSST could allow for increased utilization of the TSST by enhancing convenience, reducing labor costs, and limiting potential error variance introduced by human confederates.},

This study uses repeated cross-sectional data from the World Values Survey/European Values Study, covering 80 nations over the period from 1981 to 2013 to estimate age, period, and cohort effects on mean changes in the subjective importance of God and attendance at religious services. A cross-classified mixed model approach was used, examining both random effects indicating between-country differences in these changes and fixed factors unifying them in a broader framework. Older age was associated with greater personal and organizational religious involvement in a large majority of societies, but the strength of this association differed by culture, with the largest mean effects occurring in Western nations. Period effects were detected in many cultural areas but were very heterogeneous in direction and magnitude. Period changes were related to national wealth, with increase in per capita gross domestic product being related to declines in mean religious involvement. Cohort effects were in evidence in relatively few societies. These results indicate that both individual aging processes and changes in the material environment may influence changes in religious involvement, in keeping with both psychological and sociological theory, but that culture also plays a role in the nature and speed of these changes.},

Little is known, however, about how negative contact with the advantaged predicts collective action among members of disadvantaged groups. With samples of Black and Hispanic Americans, we tested positive and negative contact with White Americans as predictors of self-reported collective action behaviour and future intentions. Across both samples, negative contact with White Americans predicted greater collective action, largely through the mechanisms of perceived discrimination and intergroup anger. Simultaneously, positive contact showed a negative indirect effect on collective action primarily through reduced anger. These findings suggest that negative contact may be a potential driver of social change among racial minorities. Implications of these findings for the contact and collective action literatures are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective Providing care to a loved one with dementia and the death of that loved one are generally considered two of the most stressful human experiences. Each puts family caregivers at risk of psychologic morbidity. Although research has suggested that religious beliefs and practices are associated with better mental health, little is known about whether religion is associated with better mental health in family caregivers. Our objective, then, is to explore the relationship between religion and mental health in active and bereaved dementia caregivers Methods A total of 1,229 caregivers of persons with moderate to severe dementia were recruited from six geographically diverse sites in the United States and followed prospectively for up to 18 months. Three measures of religion: 1) the frequency of attendance at religious services, meetings, and/or activities; 2) the frequency of prayer or meditation; and 3) the importance of religious faith/spirituality were collected. Mental health outcomes were caregiver depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies\textendash Depression [CES-D] scale) and complicated grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief [ICG]). Results Religious beliefs and practices were important to the majority of caregivers. After controlling for significant covariates, the three measures of religion were associated with less depressive symptoms in current caregivers. Frequent attendance was also associated with less depression and complicated grief in the bereaved. Conclusions Religious beliefs and practices, and religious attendance in particular, are associated with better mental health in family caregivers of persons with dementia.},

The first form of network sampling, multiplicity sampling, involved asking respondents about events affecting those in their personal networks; it was subsequently applied to studies of homicide, HIV, and other topics, but its usefulness is limited to public events. Link-tracing designs employ a different approach to study hard-to-reach populations, using a set of respondents that expands in waves as each round of respondents recruit their peers. Link-tracing as applied to hidden populations, often described as snowball sampling, was initially considered a form of convenience sampling. This changed with the development of respondentdriven sampling (RDS), a widely used network sampling method in which the link-tracing design is adapted to provide the basis for statistical inference. The literature on RDS is large and rapidly expanding, involving contributions by numerous independent research groups employing data from dozens of different countries. Within this literature, many important research questions remain unresolved, including how best to choose among alternative RDS estimators, how to refine existing estimators to make them less dependent on assumptions that are sometimes counterfactual, and perhaps the greatest unresolved issue, how best to calculate the variability of the estimates.},

This appetite for aggression was investigated in a sample of 224 former combatants from different armed groups and forces in eastern DRC. In a semistructured interview they were questioned about their military history, exposure to violence and perpetrated violence. Appetitive aggression was assessed with a 15-item-scale (Weierstall \& Elbert, 2011), which was successfully implemented in comparable samples (Weierstall, Schalinski, Crombach, Hecker, \& Elbert, submitted for publication). A sequential multiple regression was conducted to determine possible predictors of appetitive aggression. Perpetrated violence types, recruitment type, and joining as a child were significant predictors and explained 26\% of the variability in appetitive aggression. Duration or military rank within the armed group and exposure to violence did not play a significant role. Thus, combatants reporting high levels of appetitive aggression are characterized by perpetrating a high number of violent acts, joining armed groups on their own accord and as children. Joining an armed group on one's own accord indicates pre-existing appetitive aggression. However, joining young and perpetrating violence on a regular basis seem to intensify the appetite for aggression.},

  abstract = {The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is an effective psychosocial laboratory protocol for inducing stress in humans and has been used in numerous research studies. The stressor leads to a physiological response of the hypothalamus\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal axis (HPAA) and the autonomous nervous system (ANS). Common biomarkers are cortisol levels and heart rate. In addition to the physiological stress response, the TSST also triggers a psychological response such as an increase in perceived stress, anxiety and emotional insecurity. Whereas HPA and ANS measures can easily be obtained for the TSST period itself, psychological measures are usually determined prior to (baseline) and after the TSST. This may exclude information of the stressful event itself. In the present study, we assessed perceived stress, anxiety and emotional insecurity before, during and after the TSST using visual analogue scales. In addition, cortisol levels and heart rates were assessed. Data of 260 healthy non-smoking males aged 16\textendash 60 yrs were used for analyses. Our results show that stress perception, anxiety and emotional insecurity were significantly higher during the TSST as compared to post-TSST ratings. Furthermore, our results suggest a covariance of the psychological stress response during the TSST and the physiological stress responses (cortisol and heart rate) for stress perception though the explained variance was small. This observation was not found for pre- and post-TSST ratings suggesting that assessing psychological stress measures during the stressor itself present a more informative measure of the stress response.},

While it is known that family or community care is preferable over institutional care of African orphans, little is known about the quality of care in orphanages and possibilities of improvement. Study 1 Methods: Exposure to traumatic stress, experiences of violence in the home, school and orphanage, as well as mental ill-health and aggression of 38 children (mean age of M = 8.64 years) living in an orphanage in rural Tanzania were assessed at two time points. The severity of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD), depressive symptoms, and internalizing and externalizing problems were used as indicators of mental ill-health. Results: Violence experienced in the orphanage correlated more strongly with all indicators of mental ill-health than violence in the former home, school or neighborhood at time point 1. Additionally, violence experienced in the orphanage had a positive relationship with the aggressive behavior of the children at time point 2. Study 2 Methods: With the help of the pre-post assessment of Study 1, the implementation of a new instructional system and psychotherapeutic treatment (KIDNET) for trauma-related illness were evaluated. Results: In response to both, a change in the instructional system and psychotherapeutic treatment of PTSD, a massive decline in experienced violence and in the severity of PTSD-symptoms was found, whereas depressive symptoms and internalizing and externalizing problems exhibited little change. Conclusions: These studies show that violence, especially in the orphanage, can severely contribute to mental illhealth in orphans and that mental health can be improved by implementing a new instructional system and psychotherapeutic treatment in an orphanage. Moreover, the results indicate that the experience of violence in an orphanage also plays a crucial role in aggressive behavior of the orphans.},

Research with former child soldiers has consistently shown that exposure to violence is linked to trauma-related disorders and that living in a violent environment is correlated with enhanced levels of aggression. Objective: To gain more insight into the experiences and the mental health status of former child soldiers, we conducted a survey with N200 former child soldiers and adult combatants in the DR Congo. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews concerning military experiences, experienced and perpetrated violence, and mental health. Results: Former child soldiers reported more experienced and perpetrated violence, a greater severity of trauma-related suffering, as well as higher appetitive aggression than adult ex-combatants. Appetitive aggression was related to more perpetrated violence, higher military ranks, voluntary recruitment and higher rates of reenlistments in former child soldiers. Conclusions: Our results indicate that growing up in an armed group is related to higher levels of traumarelated disorders and aggressive behavior. This may explain the challenge of reintegrating former child soldiers. It is thus important to consider mental health problems, particularly trauma-related disorders and aggressive behavior, of former child soldiers for designing adequate reintegration programs.},

  abstract = {During recent years a large variety of wearable devices have become commercially available. As these devices are in close contact with the body, they have the potential to capture sensitive and unexpected personal data even when the wearer is not moving. This work demonstrates that wearable motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes embedded in head-mounted and wrist-worn wearable devices can be used to identify the wearer (among 12 participants) and his/her body posture (among 3 positions) from only 10 seconds of ``still'' motion data. Instead of focusing on large and apparent motions such as steps or gait, the proposed methods amplify and analyze very subtle body motions associated with the beating of the heart. Our findings have the potential to increase the value of pervasive wearable motion sensors but also raise important privacy concerns that need to be considered.},

  abstract = {There is ample evidence supporting the link between stress at the workplace and physical and mental health. One of the pathways potentially mediating those associations may involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with cortisol as an end product. While theoretically plausible, findings on the association of self-reported work stress with hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are inconclusive, being potentially biased by omitted pertinent factors. This issue can be addressed, among others, by eliminating time-invariant factors through consideration of variation within persons over time. To this end, the present study examined the association between variation in HCC and perceived work stress - as assessed by the Effort-Reward-Imbalance (ERI) model - between two points in time (t1 and t2) over one year in a sample of 40 male factory workers. Neither a cross-sectional association, nor a link between change in ERI and HCC levels at t2 was observed. There was however a robust association of the change in ERI with the change of HCC. This effect was independent of baseline HCC and other confounders (Beta\,=\,0.414, S.E.\,=\,0.155, p\,=\,0.012). Accordingly, this is the first study revealing prospective evidence for the associations of work stress with HCC, while excluding potentially time-stable confounding factors, like genetic factors or phenotypic hair color.},

Methods: Using a multi-dimensional survey instrument, we conducted in-home interviews with 66 predominantly Mexican-American Catholic family caregivers near the US\textendash Mexico border. We assessed caregivers' intrinsic, organizational and non-organizational religiosity with the Duke Religiosity Index, as well as Pargament's brief positive and negative spiritual coping scale to determine the association of religiosity with caregivers' mental and physical health, depressive symptomatology and perceived burden. Results: Using regression analysis, we controlled for sociocultural factors (e.g. familism, acculturation), other forms of formal and informal support, care recipients' functional status and characteristics of the caregiving dyad. Intrinsic and organizational religiosity was associated with lower perceived burden, while nonorganizational religiosity was associated with poorer mental health. Negative religious coping (e.g. feelings that the caregiver burden is a punishment) predicted greater depression. Conclusion: Measures of well-being should be evaluated in relation to specific styles of religious and spiritual coping, given our range of findings. Further investigation is warranted regarding how knowledge of the positive and negative associations between religiosity and caregiving may assist healthcare providers in supporting Latino caregivers.},

The purpose of this study was to estimate relative mortality rates among persons joining the church in adult life compared with members of the same age who joined in childhood. Study Design and Setting: A cohort of 29,871 Seventh-day Adventist church members in California was followed for 12 years. A total of 5,109 deaths occurred during follow-up. Results: In men, the relative mortality at the time of entry into the church showed a curvilinear relation with age, with a maximum of about 2 for entry at age 50\textendash 60. For most ages at entry, the relative mortality first declined with increasing membership duration but later stabilized. Men joining at age 50 experienced a 15\textendash 25\% reduction in relative mortality after 10 years of membership. Women joining after age 50 had a somewhat higher mortality than those who joined in childhood, with no subsequent short-term change. Conclusion: The pronounced drop in relative mortality among men entering the church may reflect the adoption of a healthy lifestyle. \'C 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faces increased morbidity and mortality due to treatable and preventable noncommunicable diseases. However, it continues to struggle with political and economic instability, which impedes much needed health infrastructure improvements. The present study was designed as a low-cost determination of the prevalence of incident prediabetes/diabetes in the DRC. Method Fasting blood glucose, body mass index, blood pressure, and age were assessed in adult participants in health screenings conducted throughout urban and rural DRC. Communities were divided into three categories, based on physical activity (means of transport) and diet, ie, traditional (nonmotorized transport and vegetable/starch-based diets); transitional (incorporating traditional practices with motorized transport) and modern (motorized transport and protein/ processed foods). Fasting blood glucose and blood pressure were established using finger prick blood samples and monitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Results The prevalence of incident prediabetes/diabetes was over 47\% for the traditional population, 88.6\% for the transitional population, and 91.4\% for the modern communities. Fasting blood glucose levels analyzed through an analysis of covariance, with age and body mass index as covariates, demonstrated that fasting blood glucose levels of male and female subgroups in the traditional community (101.8 {$\pm$} 29.3 mg/dL and 95.4 {$\pm$} 27.8 mg/dL, respectively), were significantly reduced compared with the transitional (122.1 {$\pm$} 19.4 mg/dL and 122.8 {$\pm$} 23.9 mg/dL), and modern (118.8 {$\pm$} 15.9 mg/dL and 114.1 {$\pm$} 17.1 mg/dL) populations. Additionally, for the male and female subgroups, logistic regression analysis confirmed a significant association between incident prediabetes/diabetes, fasting blood glucose, diet, and level of physical activity. Conclusion There is a higher than expected prevalence of incident prediabetes/diabetes in the DRC adult population, without a clear association with risk factors pertaining to diet, level of physical activity, body mass index, and blood pressure. The substantial morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes highlights the critical need for further and more precise diabetic diagnostic testing throughout the DRC.},

  abstract = {Ideas about community are especially prominent in late-twentieth-century U.S. society. The term community resonates throughout social policy, scholarship, popular culture, and everyday social interactions. It holds significance for different populations with competing political agendas (e.g., political groups of the right and the left invoke ideas of community yet have very different ideas in mind). No longer seen as naturally occurring, apolitical spaces to which one retreats to escape the pressures of modern life, communities of all sorts now constitute sites of political engagement and contestation. The new politics of community reveals how the idea of community constitutes an elastic political construct that holds a variety of contradictory meanings and around which diverse social practices occur. In this address, I analyze how reframing the idea of community as a political construct might provide new avenues for investigating social inequalities. I first explore the utility of community as a political construct for rethinking both intersecting systems of power and activities that are routinely characterized as ``political.'' Next, by examining five contemporary sites where community is either visibly named as a political construct or implicated in significant political phenomena, I investigate how the construct of community operates within contemporary power relations of class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, nation, and race. Finally, I explore the potential intellectual and political significance of these developments.},

This study described HIV prevalence, risk behaviors, health care use, and mental health status of male-to-female and female-to-male transgender persons and determined factors associated with HIV. Methods. We recruited transgender persons through targeted sampling, respondent-driven sampling, and agency referrals; 392 male-to-female and 123 female-to-male transgender persons were interviewed and tested for HIV. Results. HIV prevalence among male-to-female transgender persons was 35\%. African American race (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.81; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.82, 11.96), a history of injection drug use (OR = 2.69; 95\% CI = 1.56, 4.62), multiple sex partners (adjusted OR = 2.64; 95\% CI = 1.50, 4.62), and low education (adjusted OR = 2.08; 95\% CI=1.17, 3.68) were independently associated with HIV. Among female-tomale transgender persons, HIV prevalence (2\%) and risk behaviors were much lower. Most male-to-female (78\%) and female-to-male (83\%) transgender persons had seen a medical provider in the past 6 months. Sixty-two percent of the male-to-female and 55\% of the femaleto-male transgender persons were depressed; 32\% of each population had attempted suicide. Conclusions. High HIV prevalence suggests an urgent need for risk reduction interventions for male-to-female transgender persons. Recent contact with medical providers was observed, suggesting that medical providers could provide an important link to needed prevention, health, and social services.

  abstract = {Introduction: The HIV/AIDS pandemic is reducing life expectancy and raising mortality. An increasing orphan population is perhaps the most tragic and long-term legacy of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. By 2010 sub-Saharan Africa is expected to have an estimated 50 million orphans and it will be staggered by this challenge. By the middle of 2006, 1.5 million children under the age of 18 years were maternal orphans in South Africa, and 66\% of these children had been orphaned as a result of HIV/AIDS. Although government and non-government organisations have responded by building orphanages, most of Africa's orphans have been absorbed into extended family networks. Many of these extended family caregivers are ageing and often impoverished grandparents. Methods: This was a descriptive, qualitative study using the free attitude interview technique. All family caregivers who consulted at the Hoekfontein Clinic, North West Province, South Africa between March and June 2006 formed the study population. A total of nine one-on-one interviews had been conducted by the time saturation of data was reached. Results: All nine caregivers were women, mostly grandmothers (67\%), and the orphans were between the ages of 5 and 20 years. Emergent themes were: poverty and lack of money; bureaucratic difficulties and lack of assistance from the social support services; lack of support (financial, physical and emotional) from other family members; frustrations of coping with rebellious orphans; pain of caring for the terminally ill family members; feelings of despondency (hopelessness); conflicts in the family; and the rejection of orphans by their fathers. Conclusions: The study showed that the family caregivers experienced a lack of welfare and family/emotional support in their care of HIV/AIDS orphans. It is recommended that health care workers, including social workers and home-based caregivers be trained on available social support from government and non-governmental organisations for caregivers of HIV/AIDS orphans.},

As more cross-country surveys are conducted every year, it may seem reasonable to use such data sets, since they provide high quality comparisons across countries. However, one should pay close attention to the measurement instruments, as these may cause unintentional but systematic variability in the observed data. While the data from each survey can be of high quality ``per se'', we claim that results from these surveys are not comparable, owing to their different measurement approaches and survey instruments. In this paper we present data from several experiments which show that scientific findings from these surveys depend significantly on questionnaire design.},

  abstract = {There is continued confusion and controversy about the importance of perception versus actual exchange of social support, that I argue in this paper leads erroneously to the conclusion that it is perception that is key. This paper argues that this confusion follows from the lack of study of the time sequence by which social support, and therefore its perception, is accumulated. Unless people are delusional, social support and its appraisal are created primarily as a product of real events in their lives. Most research comparing ``perceived'' and ``received'' social support actually compares perceptions of reality that have accumulated over long spans of time to a micro exchange of received support. Further, I illustrate that when social support does not behave as people expected (i.e., there are misperceptions) then people's belief systems about their support change, but, again, based on the facts. In this way, people are depicted as active operators in the support process, such that they make ongoing adjustments in their beliefs and in their actual social support by creating new relationships and how they interact in these relationships so that perceptions and reality match.},

Arlie Hochschild, one of the most influential sociologists of her generation, had spent the preceding five years immersed in the community around Lake Charles, Louisiana, a Tea Party stronghold. As Jedediah Purdy put it in the New Republic, "Hochschild is fascinated by how people make sense of their lives. . . . [Her] attentive, detailed portraits . . . reveal a gulf between Hochchild's 'strangers in their own land' and a new elite." Already a favorite common read book in communities and on campuses across the country and called "humble and important" by David Brooks and "masterly" by Atul Gawande, Hochschild's book has been lauded by Noam Chomsky, New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu, and countless others. The paperback edition features a new afterword by the author reflecting on the election of Donald Trump and the other events that have unfolded both in Louisiana and around the country since the hardcover edition was published, and also includes a readers' group guide at the back of the book.},

Despite a massive literature on the benefits of support, there is surprisingly little hard evidence about how, and how well, social support interventions work. Using a computerized search strategy, 100 studies that evaluated the efficacy of such interventions were located. The presenting problems ranged from cancer, loneliness, weight loss, and substance abuse to lack in parenting skills, surgery, and birth preparation. For the purpose of review and evaluation, studies were subdivided into (1) group vs. individual interventions, (2) professionally led vs. peer-provided treatment, and (3) interventions where an increase of network size or perceived support was the primary target vs. those where building social skills (to facilitate support creation) was the focus. On the whole, this review provided some support for the overall usefulness of social support interventions. However, because of the large variety of existing different treatment protocols and areas of application, there is still not enough evidence to conclude which interventions work best for what problems. Specific methodological and conceptual difficulties that plague this area of research and directions for future research are discussed. D 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The First Five Years of the Priesthood is a collaborative work of the National Federation of Priests' Councils and the Life Cycle Institute of The Catholic University of America that considers this phenomenon. It explores the experience of early priesthood and is based on a pilot survey of two groups - recently ordained priests active in service and those who have resigned.The research team minimized interpretative work on the findings and engaged credible voices in American Catholic life to write commentaries on the implications of the findings. The First Five Years of the Priesthood includes both the research findings and commentaries.Chapters are The Setting of the Priesthood Today," "Attitudes of Newly Ordained Active and Resigned Priests," "What Makes for Satisfied Newly Ordained Priests?"

  abstract = {Age-period-cohort models have provided useful insights into the analysis of time trends for disease rates, in spite of the well known identifiability problem. Unique parameter estimates that avoid arbitrary constraints are provided by estimable functions of the parameter estimates. For data that are generated using equal interval widths for age and period, the identifiability issue may be expressed in terms of the age, period and cohort slopes. However, when the interval widths are not the same for age and period, additional identifiability problems arise. These may be represented in terms of macro-trends, which have the identical identifiability problem seen in the equal interval case, and micro-trends, which are the source of the additional problems. A framework for testing estimability is presented, and a variety of potentially interesting functions of the parameters considered. Unlike the equal interval case, drift is not estimable for unequal intervals, but local drift may be. In addition, the available functions for forecasting are much more restrictive in the latter case. This estimability problem induces cyclical patterns in the estimates of trend as is demonstrated using data on leukaemia in Connecticut males, but this can be avoided through the use of smoothing splines. These methods of are illustrated for three-year period and five-year age intervals using data on lung cancer mortality in Californian women. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this meta-analytic review, our objective is to establish the overall and relative magnitude of social isolation and loneliness and to examine possible moderators. We conducted a literature search of studies (January 1980 to February 2014) using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstracts, and Google Scholar. The included studies provided quantitative data on mortality as affected by loneliness, social isolation, or living alone. Across studies in which several possible confounds were statistically controlled for, the weighted average effect sizes were as follows: social isolation odds ratio (OR) = 1.29, loneliness OR = 1.26, and living alone OR = 1.32, corresponding to an average of 29\%, 26\%, and 32\% increased likelihood of mortality, respectively. We found no differences between measures of objective and subjective social isolation. Results remain consistent across gender, length of follow-up, and world region, but initial health status has an influence on the findings. Results also differ across participant age, with social deficits being more predictive of death in samples with an average age younger than 65 years. Overall, the influence of both objective and subjective social isolation on risk for mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality.},

Objectives: This meta-analytic review was conducted to determine the extent to which social relationships influence risk for mortality, which aspects of social relationships are most highly predictive, and which factors may moderate the risk. Data Extraction: Data were extracted on several participant characteristics, including cause of mortality, initial health status, and pre-existing health conditions, as well as on study characteristics, including length of follow-up and type of assessment of social relationships. Results: Across 148 studies (308,849 participants), the random effects weighted average effect size was OR = 1.50 (95\% CI 1.42 to 1.59), indicating a 50\% increased likelihood of survival for participants with stronger social relationships. This finding remained consistent across age, sex, initial health status, cause of death, and follow-up period. Significant differences were found across the type of social measurement evaluated (p,0.001); the association was strongest for complex measures of social integration (OR = 1.91; 95\% CI 1.63 to 2.23) and lowest for binary indicators of residential status (living alone versus with others) (OR = 1.19; 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.44).

Few studies have investigated the possible associations of loneliness with mortality risk, impact on men and women and whether this impact concerns the situation of being alone (social isolation), experiencing loneliness (feeling lonely) or both. The current study investigated whether social isolation and feelings of loneliness in older men and women were associated with increased mortality risk, controlling for depression and other potentially confounding factors. Method. In our prospective cohort study of 4004 older persons aged 65\textendash 84 years with a 10-year follow-up of mortality data a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to test whether social isolation factors and feelings of loneliness predicted an increased risk of mortality, controlling for psychiatric disorders and medical conditions, cognitive functioning, functional status and sociodemographic factors. Results. At 10 years follow-up, significantly more men than women with feelings of loneliness at baseline had died. After adjustment for explanatory variables including social isolation, the mortality hazard ratio for feelings of loneliness was 1.30 [95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.04\textendash 1.63] in men and 1.04 (95 \% CI 0.90\textendash 1.24) in women. No higher risk of mortality was found for social isolation. Conclusions. Feelings of loneliness rather than social isolation factors were found to be a major risk factor for increasing mortality in older men. Developing a better understanding of the nature of this association may help us to improve quality of life and longevity, especially in older men.},

  abstract = {The epidemiology of flourishing is an important research topic prompting international interest in its psychometric assessment. But the need to measure human feelings and functioning at the population level has resulted in the creation of a multitude of different conceptual frameworks of flourishing: a term now commonly used to describe high levels of subjective wellbeing. Not only do different researchers theorise and conceptualise flourishing in different ways, but also the categorical diagnosis of flourishing is dependent upon the various combinations of components, and researcher-determined thresholds, used in each operationalization. The multiplicity of approaches is potentially limiting the usefulness of the resultant epidemiology. This paper comprises two parts: Part 1 identifies four operationalizations of flourishing in the psychology literature and reviews their psychometric properties and utility; Part 2 investigates the impact of operational definition on the prevalence of flourishing using the Sovereign Wellbeing Index survey, a sample of 10,009 adult New Zealanders, and reports substantial variation in prevalence rates according to the four different operationalizations: Huppert and So (24\%), Keyes (39\%), Diener et al. (41\%) and Seligman et al. (47\%). Huppert and So's model was the only one of the four to require endorsement of one particular variable, making it the most stringent criterion for flourishing, while the other three were more flexible in their categorisation. Cross-tabulation analysis indicated strong agreement between our replications of Keyes and Seligman et al.'s models (81\%), and between Diener et al. and Seligman et al.'s models (80\%). Agreement between Seligman, and Huppert and So's, operationalizations was moderate (74\%). Taken together, and in line with recent OECD recommendations, our findings reinforce the need for greater international collaboration and conceptualisation consensus when measuring flourishing. In the absence of any published empirical research investigating perceptions of flourishing among laypersons, a prototype analysis investigating alignment between lay and academic conceptualisations of flourishing is recommended.},

Religious denomination officials interested in preventing depression in clergy may be tempted to recommend Sabbath-keeping, although recommending other forms of rest and rejuvenation, including connecting with others, is also possible. This study examined the relationships of Sabbath-keeping as well as multiple other forms of rest and rejuvenation (vacation, sleep, relaxing activities, and social support) to mental and physical health and spiritual well-being using survey data from 1316 United Methodist clergy. Appropriate regression analyses (logistic, linear, and Poisson) were used to determine which clergy were more likely to keep the Sabbath and examined the relationships between Sabbath-keeping and multiple well-being outcomes. Receiving more social support was strongly associated with Sabbath-keeping. Sabbath-keeping was not significantly related to mental or physical health, after adjusting for covariates such as social support, although Sabbath-keeping was significantly related to higher quality of life and spiritual well-being\textemdash the original purpose of Sabbath-keeping\textemdash in clergy. To adequately test whether Sabbath-keeping could promote mental health for clergy beyond other forms of rejuvenation, intervention studies are needed.},

Several studies have shown that the amount and distribution of control in an organization affect its success in securing members' commitment, but the effects of organizationcontext on relationships between control and commitment are not thoroughly understood. Using the control graph to measure the amount and distribution of control in local churches, we examined the relationship between organization control and members' commitment (conceptualized as satisfaction, identification, and involvement) and the impact of the organization'scontext on that relationship. Ouranalysis shows that amountof controlis an importantpredictorof members' commitment; distributionof control is less important. The effects of control tend to persist when contextual variablesare statistically controlled. However, some of the organizationcontext variables-conflict,minister's tenure, and local church size-produce importantinteractioneffects.},

Since the prevalence and onset of this health problem is thought to differ between men and women, sex must be taken into account. This study aims to assess the prevalence and development of burnout among General Practitioners (GPs). In this population the prevalence of burnout is high. Methods: We performed a three-wave longitudinal study (2002, 2004, 2006) in a random sample of Dutch GPs. Data were collected by means of self-report questionnaires including the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Our final sample consisted of 212 GPs of which 128 were male. Data were analyzed by means of SPSS and LISREL. Results: Results indicate that about 20\% of the GPs is clinically burned out (but still working). For both sexes, burnout decreased after the first wave, but increased again after the second wave. The prevalence of depersonalization is higher among men. With regard to the process of burnout we found that for men burnout is triggered by depersonalization and by emotional exhaustion for women. Conclusions: As regards the developmental process of burnout, we found evidence for the fact that the aetiological process of burnout, that is the causal order of the three burnout dimensions, differs between men and women. These sex differences should be taken into account in vocational training and policy development, especially since general practice is feminizing rapidly.},

Cross-lagged panel analyses indicated that the causal direction of the relationships between demands, resources and person-related factors on the one hand, and burnout on the other is reciprocal. In addition, multi-sample analyses revealed that the pattern of relationships between job demands, job resources, person-related factors and burnout is different for men and women, although results are less clear at the second measurement point.

In this paper we employ new data and more powerful analytical tools to: (1) update the time series, (2) present further evidence of correlations between political backlash, generational succession, and religious identification, (3) show how valuing personal autonomy generally and autonomy in the sphere of sex and drugs specifically explain generational differences, and (4) use GSS panel data to show that the causal direction in the rise of the ``Nones'' likely runs from political identity as a liberal or conservative to religious identity, reversing a long-standing convention in social science research.

Study 2 considered additional specific views, further establishing measurement invariance and providing evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. Study 3 broadened the range of specific views and revealed that intellectual humility with respect to a specific view is a complex function of dispositional intellectual humility, the extremity of the view, and the basis for the view. These findings demonstrate the value of investigating intellectual humility with respect to specific views and the usefulness of the Specific Intellectual Humility Scale.},

Rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. All three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. The major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. In conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. A summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context. The authors delineate analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of end-of-life care.},

In this study, we derive the asymptotics of several popular selection procedures in SEM, including AIC, BIC, the RMSEA, and a two-stage rule for the RMSEA (RMSEA-2S). All of the results are derived under weak distributional assumptions and can be applied to a wide class of discrepancy functions. The results show that both AIC and BIC asymptotically select a model with the smallest population minimum discrepancy function (MDF) value regardless of nested or non-nested selection, but only BIC could consistently choose the most parsimonious one under nested model selection. When there are many non-nested models attaining the smallest MDF value, the consistency of BIC for the most parsimonious one fails. On the other hand, the RMSEA asymptotically selects a model that attains the smallest population RMSEA value, and the RESEA-2S chooses the most parsimonious model from all models with the population RMSEA smaller than the pre-specified cutoff. The empirical behavior of the considered criteria is also illustrated via four numerical examples.},

Acute mental stress can activate the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis, eliciting the release of catecholamines (NE and EPI) resulting in the elevation of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Combined stress (psychological and physical) can exacerbate these cardiovascular responses, which may partially contribute to the elevated risk of CVD and increased proportionate mortality risks experienced by some occupations (e.g., firefighting and law enforcement). Studies have supported the benefits of physical activity on physiological and psychological health, including the cardiovascular response to acute stress. Aerobically trained individuals exhibit lower sympathetic nervous system (e.g., HR) reactivity and enhanced cardiovascular efficiency (e.g., lower vascular reactivity and decreased recovery time) in response to physical and/or psychological stress. In addition, resistance training has been demonstrated to attenuate cardiovascular responses and improve mental health. This review will examine stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity and plausible explanations for how exercise training and physical fitness (aerobic and resistance exercise) can attenuate cardiovascular responses to stress. This enhanced functionality may facilitate a reduction in the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction. Finally, this review will also address the interaction of obesity and physical activity on cardiovascular reactivity and CVD.},

The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

This article describes a short loneliness scale developed specifically for use on a telephone survey. The scale has three items and a simplified set of response categories but appears to measure overall loneliness quite well. The authors also document the relationship between loneliness and several commonly used measures of objective social isolation. As expected, they find that objective and subjective isolation are related. However, the relationship is relatively modest, indicating that the quantitative and qualitative aspects of social relationships are distinct. This result suggests the importance of studying both dimensions of social relationships in the aging process.},

The evidence is strongest for public religious attendance and across specific religious denominations. The evidence is weakest for private religious activity. The mechanisms by which religious involvement appear to influence mortality include aspects of social integration, social regulation, and psychological resources. Conclusions: The religion-mortality literature has developed in both size and quality over the past decade. Fruitful avenues for continued research include the analysis of (1) more dimensions of religious involvement, including religious life histories; (2) population subgroups, including specific race/ethnic and socioeconomic populations; and (3) a richer set of social, psychologic, and behavioral mechanisms by which religion may be related to mortality.},

  abstract = {Research has shown that altruism is lower in diverse communities. Can this phenomenon be counteracted by government intervention? To answer this question, this paper introduces diversity to the canonical model of ``warm glow'' giving. Diversity may have two effects on incentives: it may attenuate individuals' altruistic preferences for public goods, and it may ``cool off'' the warm glow that individuals get from voluntarism. Either of these effects leads to diverse communities having lower levels of public goods, consistent with prior research. However, these effects have opposite implications for the efficacy of government intervention. I then empirically investigate whether government intervention is more effective in diverse communities. For identification, I exploit the Supreme Court-mandated 1991 expansion of the SSI program. Using a new dataset of United Methodist churches from 1984 to 2000, the results show that the expansion of SSI crowded-out charitable spending by churches. The crowd-out estimate for the average church is reasonably large, but this masks significant differences in crowd-out between communities. Crowd-out occurred almost entirely in relatively homogeneous communities; there is only modest evidence of crowd-out in racially diverse communities. Thus diverse communities, while having the lowest levels of altruism, are in this instance the most amenable to government intervention.},

An essential component of clinical interventions for T2DM is monitoring dietary intake to keep plasma glucose levels within an acceptable range. Yet, current techniques to monitor food intake are time intensive and error prone. To address this issue, we are developing techniques to automatically monitor food intake and the composition of those foods using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). This article presents the results of a clinical study in which participants consumed nine standardized meals with known macronutrients amounts (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) while wearing a CGM. We built a multitask neural network to estimate the macronutrient composition from the CGM signal, and compared it against a baseline linear regression. The best prediction result comes from our proposed neural network, trained with subject-dependent data, as measured by root mean squared relative error and correlation coefficient. These findings suggest that it is possible to estimate macronutrient composition from CGM signals, opening the possibility to develop automatic techniques to track food intake.},

We identified three classes describing religiosity at each wave (strongly religious, doctrinally religious, and weakly religious), and considered five types of change or stability in religious class membership from Wave-1 to Wave-9. Multiple regression with gender interactions revealed that men who stayed strongly religious over the period reported better psychological well-being compared to men who declined in their religiosity; no such pattern was found for women.

Many older adults worldwide are continuing to work past traditional retirement age, raising the question whether older adults experience depression, anxiety, or burnout at the same or greater levels as younger workers, and whether there are differences by age in these levels over time.Design/setting/participants:Longitudinal survey of 1161 currently employed US clergy followed every 6\textendash 12 months for up to 66 months.Measurements:Depression was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Anxiety was measured using the anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Burnout symptoms were assessed using the three components of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and sense of personal accomplishment (PA).Results:Older participants had lower scores of depression, anxiety, EE, and DP and higher levels of PA over time compared to younger adults. Levels of EE decreased for older working adults, while not significantly changing over time for those younger. DP symptoms decreased over time among those 55 years or older but increased among those 25\textendash 54 years.Conclusions:Older working adults may have higher levels of resilience and be able to balance personal life with their occupation as well as may engage in certain behaviors that increase social support and, for clergy, spiritual well-being that may decrease stress in a way that allows these older adults to appear to tolerate working longer without poorer mental health outcomes.},

The impact and burden associated with increases in custodial grandparenting, however, may differ by culture. In the United States, the caregiving role has been shown to be a significant source of stress for older adults. In cultures in which grandparents are more commonly involved in the care of young children, however, increasing caregiving roles may not be viewed as stressful. This study examines the impact of caregiving on perceived and physiological measures of stress among 640 Luo elders (60\th ) in western Kenya, where high HIV prevalence among younger-to-middle aged adults has led to a heavy burden of orphan care. Perceived stress levels were measured using the Luo Perceived Stress Scale (LPSS). Salivary cortisol and casual blood pressure were used as biomarkers of stress. Results were analyzed using random mixed effects models. Overall this study showed that caregivers have higher levels of perceived stress than noncaregivers. For women, household composition, including the number of orphans and adults in the homestead impacted perceived stress. Among men, those who perceived caregiving as burdensome had higher perceived stress. Despite the association between caregiving and perceived stress, there was a minimal relationship between caregiving and the two biomarkers of stress. This may be because caregiving is superimposed onto other stressors and therefore has a minimal physiological impact. These results highlight the importance of local context in determining the impact of the caregiving role on older adult well-being.},

Long-running surveys in the United States and Europe show steady generational decline in religious affiliation and participation, and yet this trend has largely been ignored by gerontologists and life course researchers. We examined data from the Health and Retirement Study, hypothesizing between-cohort declines in religious participation. Based on data from a sample stratified by 10-year birth cohorts, we identified variation in patterns of religious involvement from 2004 to 2016. Measures of attending religious services, feeling religion is very important, and having good friends in the congregation show age-graded patterns; older cohorts have a higher level of religiosity than those following them, with only minor exceptions. For all three measures, differences by cohort within waves of data are statistically significant. We confirm, with longitudinal data, the findings of repeated cross-sectional surveys in the United States showing a generational pattern of decline in religiousness. The consequences of this loss of a common social tie for future older cohorts are unknown, since current older cohorts still maintain a high level of religious participation. However, future generations of older adults are likely to be less familiar with social support from religious institutions, and those institutions may be less available to provide such support as the apparently inexorable processes of secularization continue.},

Their attitudes concerning mental illnesses would influence community mental health intervention efforts. This study aimed to determine the attitudes of clergy towards persons with mental illness. Method: A cross-sectional survey of clergy (n= 107) of the Christian and Muslim faiths was conducted, using a socio-demographic questionnaire and the 40- item Community Attitudes towards Mental Illness (CAMI) scale. Results: Stigmatizing attitudes were evident among members of the clergy surveyed. Most (71.1\%) believed the mentally ill were different from other persons, while 68.2\% were of the opinion that the mentally ill should be controlled like children. Over 80\% of respondents were not comfortable with the idea of the mentally ill living in their vicinity and wanted mental health hospitals situated out of residential areas. Almost half of respondents (45.8\%) were uncomfortable with women who were once mentally ill baby-sitting and 63.2\% agreed that our mental hospitals seem more like prisons than where the mentally ill can be cared for. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards the mentally ill were widespread among the clergy sampled. Mental health professionals need to take proactive steps to improve the mental health knowledge of the clergy which may facilitate their roles in the pathway to mental health care.},

The club-theoretic model suggests that individuals with lower socioeconomic standing will rationally be more likely to align themselves with exclusivistic sects. Because sect affiliation is also associated with more obligatory religious contributions, this approach generates novel predictions not anticipated by standard economic models of charitable behavior. Traditional analysis of charitable giving can mask the "sect effect" phenomenon, as low-income giving is dwarfed by the giving of the wealthy. However, the application of a two-stage econometric model?separating the participation decision from the subsequent decision regarding the level of gifting?provides unique insights. Basic socioeconomic factors have significant and opposite associations with different categories of giving, calling into question the treatment of charitable giving as a homogenous activity and supporting the under standing of sect affiliation, and potentially religious extremism, as rational choice phenomena.},

  abstract = {The propensity score plays a central role in a variety of causal inference settings. In particular, matching and weighting methods based on the estimated propensity score have become increasingly common in the analysis of observational data. Despite their popularity and theoretical appeal, the main practical difficulty of these methods is that the propensity score must be estimated. Researchers have found that slight misspecification of the propensity score model can result in substantial bias of estimated treatment effects. We introduce covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) methodology, which models treatment assignment while optimizing the covariate balance. The CBPS exploits the dual characteristics of the propensity score as a covariate balancing score and the conditional probability of treatment assignment. The estimation of the CBPS is done within the generalized method-of-moments or empirical likelihood framework. We find that the CBPS dramatically improves the poor empirical performance of propensity score matching and weighting methods reported in the literature. We also show that the CBPS can be extended to other important settings, including the estimation of the generalized propensity score for non-binary treatments and the generalization of experimental estimates to a target population. Open source software is available for implementing the methods proposed.},

However, a study of the official interpretive documents and of 200 cases of members of The Church of Almighty God sentenced in China supports the conclusion that normal religious activities, such as attending worship services, trying to convert friends and relatives, or distributing religious literature are among the ``crimes'' punished under article 300 with severe jail penalties.},

Democrats and Republicans both say that the other party's members are hypocritical, selfish, and closed-minded, and they are unwilling to socialize across party lines. This phenomenon of animosity between the parties is known as affective polarization. We trace its origins to the power of partisanship as a social identity, and explain the factors that intensify partisan animus. We also explore the consequences of affective polarization, highlighting how partisan affect influences attitudes and behaviors well outside the political sphere. Finally, we discuss strategies that might mitigate partisan discord and conclude with suggestions for future work.},

Recent studies using positive psychology as a framework identify a number of personal and situational qualities that promote resilience in clergy. Based on these findings, I suggest interventions that should be made by faith groups to better support clergy and make recommendations for further research.},

Consistent with expectations, analyses showed that numerical rarity by race and by gender significantly increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Numerical rarity by race significantly increases "token stress" (e.g., loss of black identity, multiple demands of being black, sense of isolation, having to show greater competence) and a high degree of gender tokenism increases role overload. Some, but not all, of the total impact of proportional representation is mediated through work stressors since these stressors are themselves directly associated with higher psychological symptoms.},

  abstract = {Background Obesity is associated with increased morbidity, occupational injuries, and premature mortality. Obesity also disproportionately affects blacks and socioeconomically disadvantaged workers. However, few studies have evaluated national trends of obesity by employment industry overall and especially by race. Methods To investigate national trends of obesity by employment industry overall and by race, we estimated the age-standardized obesity prevalence from 2004 to 2011. We used direct age-standardization with the 2000 US Census population as the standard among 136,923 adults in the US National Health Interview Survey. We also estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) for obesity in black women and men compared to their white counterparts for each employment industry using adjusted Poisson regression models with robust variance. Results Obesity prevalence increased for men and women over the study period across all employment industry categories, and the healthcare industry had the highest overall age-standardized prevalence (30~\%). Black women had a significantly higher obesity prevalence than white women across all employment industry categories, ranging from 33~\% (95~\% confidence interval (CI): 1.16,1.52) in Professional/Management to 74~\% in Education (95~\% CI: 1.56,1.93). Obesity prevalence was higher among black than white men for Healthcare (PR\,=\,1.39 [1.15,1.69]), Education (PR\,=\,1.39 [1.17,1.67]), Public Administration (PR\,=\,1.34 [1.20,1.49]), and Manufacturing (PR\,=\,1.19 [1.11,1.27]). Differences in obesity prevalence by race were generally widest in professional/management occupations. Conclusions Obesity trends varied substantially overall as well as within and between race-gender groups across employment industries. These findings demonstrate the need for further investigation of racial and sociocultural disparities in the work-obesity relationship to employ strategies designed to address these disparities while improving health among all US workers. Further research and interventions among workers in industries with an increasing or high prevalence of obesity should be prioritized.

One month reliability was found to be high for all questionnaires except those pertaining only to the last week or month. Longer term test-retest reliability tended to be lower. Validity was studied in relation to treadmill exercise performance, vital capacity, body fatness, the average of 14 4-wk physical activity histories and the average of 14 2-d accelerometer readings. No questionnaire measure was correlated with the accelerometer reading, and correlations with vital capacity were generally low. Only the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire household chores measure was correlated with habitual performance of household chores. Most questionnaires, even very simple ones, were related to performance of heavy intensity physical activity and treadmill performance; these same questionnaires tended to be related to percent body fat. Fewer questionnaires related to performance of light or moderate activity. Occupational activity was unrelated to any of the validation measures. It is concluded that there are multiple, nonoverlapping dimensions of physical activity, reflected in multiple nonoverlapping validation realms. More important than the length or attention to detail of a questionnaire seems to be the logic of its questions. Important areas of physical activity that should be addressed in future questionnaires include sleep, light, moderate and heavy intensity leisure activities, household chores, and occupational activity. Recent versus habitual activity should also be considered.},

  abstract = {In a panoramic study that draws on diverse sources, Jerry Jacobs and Kathleen Gerson explain why and how time pressures have emerged and what we can do to alleviate them. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that all Americans are overworked, they show that time itself has become a form of social inequality that is dividing Americans in new ways--between the overworked and the underemployed, women and men, parents and non-parents. They piece together a compelling story of the increasing mismatch between our economic system and the needs of American families, sorting out important trends such as the rise of demanding jobs and the emergence of new pressures on dual earner families and single parents.  Comparing American workers with their European peers, Jacobs and Gerson also find that policies that are simultaneously family-friendly and gender equitable are not fully realized in any of the countries they examine. As a consequence, they argue that the United States needs to forge a new set of solutions that offer American workers new ways to integrate work and family life.

Where Do We Go from Here?  Appendix: Supplementary Tables Notes References Index Jacobs and Gerson present the most fine-grained analysis yet offered of working time and its impacts on families. They successfully combine sophisticated analyses of quantitative data with breakthroughs in the conceptualization of work time. Their focus on household work time and their incorporation of subjective aspects of work-family conflict are welcome additions to the study of work time. As a result of their nuanced treatment, they avoid making simplistic generalizations that have marked many previous treatments of this topic.--Rosalind Chait Barnett, Brandeis University, and co-author of Same Difference: How Myths About Gender Differences Are Hurting Our Relationships, Our Children, and Our JobsThis is an outstanding book. It offers powerful arguments in the debates over work-family conflict going on in academia and society. The data the authors bring to bear on the subject offer new insights that support their analysis and policy recommendations. Scholars of the workplace and of contemporary American society as well as public policy advocates must read this book!--Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, City University of New York, and co-author of The Part-time Paradox: Time Norms, Professional Life, Family and GenderThe Time Divide makes a substantial contribution to the work-family literature and will be cited often by those with an interest in women's employment, children's well-being, family functioning, and work in America. Its appeal will be broad and capture the attention of policy makers along with academics in a number of disciplines including sociology, family studies, and public policy. The book is engagingly written and the logic of the analysis is sound.--Suzanne Bianchi, University of Maryland, and co-author of Continuity and Change in the American FamilyThe main thesis is original and important: that Americans are not, in general, overworked; rather, they can be divided into both the overworked and the underworked. The former are usually found in the upper half of the occupational distribution, the latter in the lower half. The overworked wish they could work less, and the underworked wish they could work more. Overall, The Time Divide significantly advances our understanding of just where the time divide lies. And that's an important contribution.--Andrew J.

The morbidity and mortality experience of various religious groups is portrayed, including Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, the clergy, Seventh-day Adventists, Latter-day Saints, Parsis, Jehovah's Witnesses and Hutterites. Studies of religious effects on morbidity and mortality have broadened in focus from the study of specific health practices, or health-related behaviors, to include the study of social support, religious participation and health-related attitudes. Gaps in the literature are identified and a preliminary model of religion's effect on morbidity and mortality is discussed.},

In this study, I report the results of six experiments in question form conducted on a 1997 nationwide survey of 1,986 adult (age 18+) Kazakhstanis, 47 percent of whom are Kazakh and 34 percent of whom are Russian. Acquiescence bias is found among the entire sample, but it is stronger for ethnic Kazakhs than for ethnic Russians. Acquiescence bias is thus a problem of both question format and individual proclivities. Attitude statements with agree-disagree response sets are less valid measures of public attitudes than balanced questions with forced-choice response alternatives, and their use could cause erroneous inferences about ethnic differences in attitudes.]},

  abstract = {Why has Christianity, a religion premised upon neighborly love, failed in its attempts to heal social divisions? In this ambitious and wide-ranging work, Willie James Jennings delves deep into the late medieval soil in which the modern Christian imagination grew, to reveal how Christianity\textbackslash 's highly refined process of socialization has inadvertently created and maintained segregated societies. A probing study of the cultural fragmentation-social, spatial, and racial-that took root in the Western mind, this book shows how Christianity has consistently forged Christian nations rather than encouraging genuine communion between disparate groups and individuals. Weaving together the stories of Zurara, the royal chronicler of Prince Henry, the Jesuit theologian Jose de Acosta, the famed Anglican Bishop John William Colenso, and the former slave writer Olaudah Equiano, Jennings narrates a tale of loss, forgetfulness, and missed opportunities for the transformation of Christian communities. Touching on issues of slavery, geography, Native American history, Jewish-Christian relations, literacy, and translation, he brilliantly exposes how the loss of land and the supersessionist ideas behind the Christian missionary movement are both deeply implicated in the invention of race. Using his bold, creative, and courageous critique to imagine a truly cosmopolitan citizenship that transcends geopolitical, nationalist, ethnic, and racial boundaries, Jennings charts, with great vision, new ways of imagining ourselves, our communities, and the landscapes we inhabit.},

Methods: Stress perceptions and four indicators of diurnal cortisol (area-under-the-curve, awakening, afternoon/evening, and cortisol awakening response [CAR] levels) were assessed on 12 different days over 6 years in a sample of 135 community-dwelling older adults. Results: Hierarchical linear models showed that although pessimists secreted relatively elevated areaunder-the-curve, awakening, and afternoon/evening levels of cortisol (but not CAR) on days they perceived stress levels that were higher than their normal average, optimists were protected from these stress-related elevations in cortisol. However, when absolute stress levels were compared across participants, there was only a significant effect for predicting CAR (but not the other cortisol measures), indicating that optimism was associated particularly strongly with a reduced CAR among participants who experienced high levels of stress. Conclusions: Dispositional optimism can buffer the association between stress perceptions and elevated levels of diurnal cortisol when individuals perceive higher-thannormal levels of stress, and it may predict a reduced CAR among individuals who generally perceive high stress levels. Research should examine relative, in addition to absolute, levels of stress to identify the personality factors that help individuals adjust to psychological perceptions of stress.},

In social conflicts characterized by mutual distrust, voices of dissent are routinely distorted or dismissed. Polarization is one of the biblical ``powers'' that oppose and obscure the Reign of God. Drawing on conflict transformation literature and Anabaptist ecclesiology, I argue that political theologians must address the political processes and discursive factors that prevent dissenting voices from being heard rightly. Christian witness in divided societies must be simultaneously prophetic and reconciling, not standing apart from political organizations but working to challenge the resentment and chronic misrepresentation that often undermine activism and the pursuit of justice and peace. Given their emphasis on nonviolence and dialogue, Mennonites in particular are well-positioned to address polarization as a theological problem.},

Subjects were randomly assigned to a six-month control or 1 of 3 eight-month exercise training groups: 1) low-amount/moderate-intensity (equivalent to walking \textasciitilde 19 km/week); 2) low-amount/vigorous-intensity (equivalent to jogging \textasciitilde 19 km/week); 3) high-amount/vigorous-intensity (equivalent to jogging \textasciitilde 32 km/week). The lowamount/moderate-intensity exercise prescription improved MS relative to inactive controls (p{$<$}0.05). However, the same amount of exercise at a vigorous intensity was not significantly better than inactive controls, suggesting that lower intensity exercise may be more effective in improving MS. The high-amount/vigorous-intensity group improved MS relative to controls (p{$<$}0.0001), the lowamount/vigorous-intensity group (p=0.001), and the moderate intensity group (p=0.07), suggesting an exercise dose effect. In conclusion, a modest amount of moderate intensity exercise, in the absence of dietary changes, significantly improved MS and thus supports the recommendation that adults get 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every day. A higher amount of vigorous exercise was shown to have greater and more widespread benefits. Finally, there is an indication that moderate intensity may be better than vigorous intensity exercise for improving MS.},

Results suggest that cohort replacement provides little explanatory power. Instead, we find large age effects, with the young more likely to be pro-environmental in their views, and substantial changes across time periods (but not steady rising support). These results suggest that there is no inexorable march toward greater environmentalism as younger cohorts with greater environmental awareness replace older ones, and highlight the relative lack of explicit theorizing about the relationship between age and the environment.},

  abstract = {A 1987 follow-up study of pastors of six Protestant denominations in Oregon reveals that theologically based differences on various controversial issues were more pronounced than they had been in 1962. Three factors appear, however, to mitigate the effects of the increased divergence of views. For one thing, the scope of conflict is narrowed because many of the issues of chief concern to the members of one camp are of less concern to members of the other. Another mitigating influence is the tendency of liberals and conservatives in theologically heterogeneous denominations to moderate their views in the interest of harmony. A third factor is the continuing existence of common concerns, such as alleviating world hunger. An examination of the issues that have recently mobilized theological conservatives demonstrates that their resistance to cultural innovations is selective and that they have abandoned or neglected several causes they once championed.},

  abstract = {Background: COVID-19 and its associated restrictions around in-person gatherings have created unprecedented challenges for religious congregations and those who lead them. While several surveys have attempted to describe how pastors and congregations responded to COVID-19, these provide a relatively thin picture of how COVID-19 is impacting religious life. There is scant qualitative data describing the lived reality of religious leaders and communities during the pandemic. Purpose and methods: This paper provides a more detailed look at how pastors and congregations experienced and responded to COVID-19 and its associated restrictions in the early period of the pandemic. To do so, we draw from 26 in-depth interviews with church-appointed United Methodist pastors conducted between June and August 2020. Pastors were asked to describe how their ministry changed as a result of COVID-19 and interviews were analyzed using applied thematic analysis approaches to identify the most common emergent themes. Results: Pastors reported that COVID-19 fundamentally unsettled routine ways of doing ministry. This disruption generated both challenges and opportunities for clergy and their congregations. In the findings, we describe how clergy responded in key areas of ministry-worship and pastoral care-and analyze how the pandemic is (re)shaping the way that clergy understood their role as pastors and envisioned the future of the Church. We argue for the value of examining the pandemic as an "unsettled" cultural period (Swidler 1986) in which religious leaders found creative ways to (re)do ministry in the context of social distancing. Rather than starting from scratch, we found that pastors drew from and modified existing symbolic and practical tools to fit pandemic-related constraints on religious life. Notably, however, we found that "redoing" ministry was easier and more effective in some areas (worship) than others (pastoral care). Conclusions and implications: The impact of COVID-19 on pastors and congregations is complex and not fully captured by survey research. This study provides a baseline for investigating similarities and differences in the responses of pastors within and across denominations and traditions. It also provides a baseline for assessing whether changes in ministry implemented during the early stages of the pandemic remain in place in the post-COVID world.},

Given the physical health problems faced by clergy, understanding where physical health falls within the priorities of seminary students, the ways students conceptualize physical health, and how seminary students do or do not attend to their physical health in the years immediately prior to becoming clergy, can inform intervention development for both seminary students and clergy. Moreover, understanding and shaping the health practices of aspiring clergy may be particularly impactful, with cascading effects, as clergy serve as important role models for their congregants. Drawing on 36 in-depth, qualitative interviews with first-year seminary students, this study examines the complex dynamics between religious frameworks related to physical health, explicit intentions to maintain healthy practices, and reported physical health behaviors. Our findings suggest that even students who deploy religious frameworks in relation to their physical health\textemdash and who, as a result, possess positive intentions to implement and maintain healthy behaviors\textemdash often report being unable to live up to their aspirations, especially in the face of barriers to health practices posed by the seminary program itself. After reviewing these findings, we offer suggestions for physical health focused interventions, including action and coping planning, which could be implemented at seminaries to reduce the intention\textendash behavior gap and improve clergy health.},

Weighted GEE has therefore been proposed to allow the validity of GEE's under the weaker missing at random assumption. Multiple imputation offers an attractive alternative, by which the incomplete data are pre-processed, and afterwards the standard GEE can be applied to the imputed data. Nevertheless, the imputation methodology requires correct specification of the imputation model. Dual imputation method provides a new way to increase the robustness of imputations with respect to model misspecification. The method involves integrating the so-called doubly robust ideas into the imputation model. Focusing on incomplete binary longitudinal data, we combine DIM and GEE (DIM-GEE) and study the relative performance of the new method in a case study of obesity among children, as well as a simulation study.},

  author = {Jolani, S},
  year = {2012},
  publisher = {{Utrecht University}},
  abstract = {Missing data are an important practical problem in many applications of statistics, including social and behavioral sciences. The older and simple strategy is to choose ad-hoc methods (e.g. available case, complete case) which introduces bias in estimation methods and also changes the data features like variability, symmetry and so on. A better strategy is to use principled methods such as Multiple Imputation (MI) or Maximum Likelihood. MI refers to a procedure in which each missing datum is imputed (filled in) with more than one value. This allows for uncertainty about which value to impute. MI is generally accepted, and can be used with virtually any kind of data. Moreover, software is available to perform the analyses. The most complex step in MI is to specify a model from which imputations are drawn. Building an imputation model is standard when the missingness mechanism is at random, in the sense that the probability to be missing depends on the observed data only. However, it can be easily misspecified, especially with multivariate missing data. Thus, it is essential to develop techniques to protect the imputation model from misspecification. This enhances the quality of imputations and the statistical inferences performed on the data. The first part of this dissertation provides new imputation methods for handling multivariate missing data with a general pattern of missingness. We develop a new methodology that incorporates the concept of double robustness property within the MCMC-based algorithms for imputation of missing values. When the missingness mechanism is not at random (MNAR), the incomplete variables are a part of the nonresponse model. This makes the imputation task even more difficult because the imputation model depends on unobserved data. One general strategy is to incorporate a model for the missingness into the imputation model. An important issue then is the necessity of making extra assumptions about the process that leads to missingness. Unfortunately, these assumptions can not be fully verified from the observed data, and thus conducting sensitivity analysis is advisable. We propose a novel imputation method, called the Random Indicator (RI) method, for the data that are MNAR. The RI method makes assumptions about the missingness mechanism and the distribution of the observed part of the incomplete variable. That is, it assumes a logistic transformation for the mechanism that creates missing data, and a normal distribution for the observed part of the incomplete variable. The RI method, in comparison to the existing methodology, is minimal in the assumptions it makes, and creates automatic imputations without user's intervention for the data that are MNAR},

Jones delivers a provocative examination of the unholy relationship between American Christianity and white supremacy, and issues an urgent call for white Christians to reckon with this legacy for the sake of themselves and the nation.As the nation grapples with demographic changes and the legacy of racism in America, Christianity's role as a cornerstone of white supremacy has been largely overlooked. But white Christians\textemdash from evangelicals in the South to mainline Protestants in the Midwest and Catholics in the Northeast\textemdash have not just been complacent or complicit; rather, as the dominant cultural power, they have constructed and sustained a project of protecting white supremacy and opposing black equality that has framed the entire American story. With his family's 1815 Bible in one hand and contemporary public opinion surveys by Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) in the other, Robert P. Jones delivers a groundbreaking analysis of the repressed history of the symbiotic relationship between Christianity and white supremacy. White Too Long demonstrates how deeply racist attitudes have become embedded in the DNA of white Christian identity over time and calls for an honest reckoning with a complicated, painful, and even shameful past. Jones challenges white Christians to acknowledge that public apologies are not enough\textemdash accepting responsibility for the past requires work toward repair in the present. White Too Long is not an appeal to altruism. Drawing on lessons gleaned from case studies of communities beginning to face these challenges, Jones argues that contemporary white Christians must confront these unsettling truths because this is the only way to salvage the integrity of their faith and their own identities. More broadly, it is no exaggeration to say that not just the future of white Christianity but the outcome of the American experiment is at stake.},

Controlling for gender, age, and negative affectivity, the results primarily supported the hypothesis that Time 1 job characteristics influence Time 2 psychological well-being. More specifically, Time 2 job satisfaction was determined by Time 1 job demands and workplace social support, respectively. Furthermore, there was also some preliminary but weak evidence for reversed cross-lagged effects since Time 1 emotional exhaustion seemed to be the causal dominant factor with respect to Time 2 (perceived) job demands. In conclusion, this study builds on earlier cross-sectional and longitudinal findings by eliminating confounding factors and diminishing methodological deficiencies. Empirical support for the influence of job characteristics on psychological well-being affirms what several theoretical models have postulated to be the causal ordering among job characteristics and work-related psychological well-being.},

  abstract = {Using employer\textendash employee matched data from Sweden between 2001 and 2008, we test hypotheses designed to assess the contingent nature of the relationship between wage dispersion and cross-firm mobility. Whereas past research has mostly established that dispersed wages increase interfirm mobility, we investigate the conditions under which pay variance might have the opposite effect, serving to retain workers. We propose that the effect of wage dispersion is contingent on organizational rank and that it depends on whether wages are dispersed vertically (between job levels) or horizontally (within the same job level). We find that vertical wage dispersion suppresses cross-firm mobility because it is associated with outcomes beneficial for employees, such as attractive advancement opportunities. By contrast, horizontal wage dispersion increases cross-firm mobility because it is associated with outcomes harmful for employees, such as inequity concerns. We further find that the vertical-dispersion effect is amplified (mitigated) for bottom (top) different-level wage earners because bottom (top) wage earners have the most (least) to gain from climbing the job ladder. Similarly, the horizontal-dispersion effect is amplified (mitigated) for bottom (top) same-level wage earners because bottom (top) wage earners are most (least) subject to negative consequences of this dispersion. More broadly, this study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between wage dispersion and cross-firm mobility.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2017.1169.},

These traditions provide not just rival definitions but also other insights that can be useful for psychological investigations.

Early studies show that government affirmative action reviews improved the numbers, and rank, of blacks, but evidence of what has happened since 1980 is sparse. There is little evidence that civil rights lawsuits improved the employment status of women or African Americans. We examine establishment-level effects of compliance reviews and lawsuits on the percentage of women and blacks in management. We find that compliance reviews, which alter organizational routines, had stronger and more lasting effects than lawsuits, which create disincentives to discriminate. We also find that deregulation was more consequential for compliance reviews than for lawsuits: Compliance reviews initiated in the 1980s were less effective than those initiated in the 1970s. Not so for lawsuits. Compared to lawsuits, compliance reviews appear to have a greater capacity to elicit lasting organizational change, but their effects are mediated by the regulatory environment.},

In particular, the relative importance of militarized compared to civilian rape and the impact on vulnerable populations merits further study. We describe a retrospective case series of sexual abuse among children and youth in eastern DRC. Methods Medical records of patients treated for sexual assault at HEAL Africa Hospital, Goma, DRC between 2006 and 2008 were reviewed. Information extracted from the chart record was summarized using descriptive statistics, with comparative statistics to examine differences between pediatric ({$\leq$}18 yrs) and adult patients. Findings 440 pediatric and 54 adult sexual abuse cases were identified. Children and youth were more often assaulted by someone known to the family (74\% vs 30\%, OR 6.7 [95\%CI 3.6\textendash 12], p{$<$}0.001), and less frequently by military personnel (13\% vs 48\%, OR 0.14 [95\%CI 0.075\textendash 0.26], p{$<$}0.001). Delayed presentation for medical care ({$>$}72 hours after the assault) was more common in pediatric patients (53\% vs 33\%, OR 2.2 [95\%CI 1.2\textendash 4.0], p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.007). Physical signs of sexual abuse, including lesions of the posterior fourchette, hymeneal tears, and anal lesions, were more commonly observed in children and youth (84\% vs 69\%, OR 2.3 [95\%CI 1.3\textendash 4.4], p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.006). Nine (2.9\%) pediatrics patients were HIV-positive at presentation, compared to 5.3\% of adults (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.34). Interpretation World media attention has focused on violent rape as a weapon of war in the DRC. Our data highlight some neglected but important and distinct aspects of the ongoing epidemic of sexual violence: sexual abuse of children and youth.},

Adverse childhood experiences have been associated with negative physical and psychological health outcomes, but this phenomenon lacks the clear, consistent meaning necessary for use in nursing research, theory development and practice. Design. Concept clarification. Data Sources. The literature search was not limited a priori by date and included publications with abstracts in English from PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Social Abstracts. The search retrieved 128 articles published from 1970\textendash 2013. The search term `adverse childhood experiences' was used, with similar terms permitted. A snowball approach was used to expand the search to relevant literature. Methods. The articles were read and analysed following Norris's five steps for concept clarification to refine, elucidate and operationally define the concept and the context in which it occurred. Results. Adverse childhood experiences were defined operationally as childhood events, varying in severity and often chronic, occurring in a child's family or social environment that cause harm or distress, thereby disrupting the child's physical or psychological health and development. Conclusion. This concept clarification should raise awareness and understanding of the diverse nature and shared characteristics of adverse childhood experiences that are believed to influence the health of individuals as they age. This clarified concept will help expand research on health consequences of adverse childhood experiences and interventions to improve health. We recommend promoting a model of primary care that pays attention to the social and familial influences on the health of individuals worldwide.},

  abstract = {Several years of war have created a humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with extensive disruption of civil society, the economy and provision of basic services including health care. Health policy and planning in the DRC are constrained by a lack of reliable and accessible population data. Thus there is currently a need for primary research to guide programme and policy development for reconstruction and to measure attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This study uses the 2001 Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey to disentangle children's health inequalities by mapping the impact of geographical distribution of childhood morbidity stemming from diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, and fever. We observe a low prevalence of childhood diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection and fever in the western provinces (Kinshasa, Bas-Congo and Bandundu), and a relatively higher prevalence in the south-eastern provinces (Sud-Kivu and Katanga). However, each disease has a distinct geographical pattern of variation. Among covariate factors, child age had a significant association with disease prevalence. The risk of the three ailments increased in the first 8\textendash 10 months after birth, with a gradual improvement thereafter. The effects of socioeconomic factors vary according to the disease. Accounting for the effects of the geographical location, our analysis was able to explain a significant share of the pronounced residual geographical effects. Using large scale household survey data, we have produced for the first time spatial residual maps in the DRC and in so doing we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of geographical variation at province level of childhood diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, and fever prevalence. Understanding these complex relationships through disease prevalence maps can facilitate design of targeted intervention programs for reconstruction and achievement of the MDGs.},

We investigate the impact of geographic location on child nutritional status by mapping the residual net effect of malnutrition while accounting for important risk factors. Methods We examine spatial variation in under-five malnutrition with flexible geo-additive semi-parametric mixed model while simultaneously controlling for spatial dependence and possibly nonlinear effects of covariates within a simultaneous, coherent regression framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. Individual data records were constructed for children. Each record represents a child and consists of nutritional status information and a list of covariates. For the 8,992 children born within the last five years before the survey, 3,663 children have information on anthropometric measures. Our novel empirical approach is able to flexibly determine to what extent the substantial spatial pattern of malnutrition is driven by detectable factors such as socioeconomic factors and can be attributable to unmeasured factors such as conflicts, political, environmental and cultural factors. Results Although childhood malnutrition was more pronounced in all provinces of the DRC, after accounting for the location's effects, geographic differences were significant: malnutrition was significantly higher in rural areas compared to urban centres and this difference persisted after multiple adjustments. The findings suggest that models of nutritional intervention must be carefully specified with regard to residential location. Conclusion Childhood malnutrition is spatially structured and rates remain very high in the provinces that rely on the mining industry and comparable to the level seen in Eastern provinces under conflicts. Even in provinces such as Bas-Congo that produce foods, childhood malnutrition is higher probably because of the economic decision to sell more than the population consumes. Improving maternal and child nutritional status is a prerequisite for achieving MDG 4, to reduce child mortality rate in the DRC.},

The reform of DRC health system, based on Health District model, is needed in order to tackle this public issue. This article used 2006 International Diabetes Federation (IDF)'s guidelines to assess the capacities of health facilities belonging to Kinshasa Primary Health Care Network (KPHCN) in terms of equipments, as well as the knowledge, and the practice of their health providers related to type 2 diabetes care. Methods A multicentric cross-sectional study was carried in 18 Health Facilities (HF) of KPHCN in charge of the follow-up of diabetic patients. The presence of IDF recommended materials and equipment was checked and 28 health providers were interviewed about their theoretical knowledge about patients' management and therapeutic objectives during recommended visits. Chi square test or Fisher exact test was used to compare proportions and the Student t-test to compare means. Results The integration of NCD healthcare in the KPHC network is feasible. The majority of HF possessed IDF recommended materials except for the clinical practice guidelines, urinary test strips, and monofilament, available in only one, two and four HF, respectively. KPHCN referral facilities had required materials for biochemical analyses, the ECG and for the fundus oculi test. Patients' management is characterized by a lack of attention on the impairment of renal function during the first visits and a poor respect of recommended practices during quarterly and annual visits. A poor knowledge of the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors-related therapeutic objectives has been also reported. Conclusion The capacities, knowledge, and practice of T2D care were poor among HF of KPHCN. The lack of equipment and training of healthcare professionals should be supplied even to those who are not medical doctors. Special attention must to be put on the clinical practice guidelines formulation and sensitization and on supervision.},

  abstract = {While epidemiological data support the link between reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and a multitude of pathologies, the mechanisms underlying changes in HRV and disease progression are poorly understood. Even though we have numerous rodent models of disease for mechanistic studies, not being able to reliably measure HRV in conscious, freely moving rodents has hindered our ability to extrapolate the role of HRV in the progression from normal physiology to pathology. The sheer number of heart beats per day ({$>$}800,000 in mice) makes data exclusion both time consuming and daunting. We sought to evaluate an RR interval exclusion method based on percent (\%) change of adjacent RR intervals. Two approaches were evaluated: \% change from ``either'' and ``both'' adjacent RR intervals. The data exclusion method based on standard deviation (SD) was also evaluated for comparison. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the performance of each method. Results showed that exclusion based on \% change from ``either'' adjacent RR intervals was the most accurate method in identifying normal and abnormal RR intervals, with an overall accuracy of 0.92\textendash 0.99. As the exclusion value increased (\% change or SD), the sensitivity (correctly including normal RR intervals) increased exponentially while the specificity (correctly rejecting abnormal RR intervals) decreased linearly. Compared to the SD method, the ``either'' approach had a steeper rise in sensitivity and a more gradual decrease in specificity. The intersection of sensitivity and specificity where the exclusion criterion had the same accuracy in identifying normal and abnormal RR intervals was 10\textendash 20\% change for the ``either'' approach and {$\sim$} 1 SD for the SD-based exclusion method. Graphically (tachogram and Lorenz plot), 20\% change from either adjacent RR interval resembled the data after manual exclusion. Finally, overall (SDNN) and short-term (rMSSD) indices of HRV generated using 20\% change from ``either'' adjacent RR intervals as the exclusion criterion were closer to the manual exclusion method with lower subject-to-subject variability than those generated using the 2 SD exclusion criterion. Thus, 20\% change from ``either'' adjacent RR intervals is a good criterion for data exclusion for reliable 24-h time domain HRV analysis in rodents.},

  abstract = {Logit and probit models are widely used in empirical sociological research. However, the common practice of comparing the coefficients of a given variable across differently specified models fitted to the same sample does not warrant the same interpretation in logits and probits as in linear regression. Unlike linear models, the change in the coefficient of the variable of interest cannot be straightforwardly attributed to the inclusion of confounding variables. The reason for this is that the variance of the underlying latent variable is not identified and will differ between models. We refer to this as the problem of rescaling. We propose a solution that allows researchers to assess the influence of confounding relative to the influence of rescaling, and we develop a test to assess the statistical significance of confounding. A further problem in making comparisons is that, in most cases, the error distribution, and not just its variance, will differ across models. Monte Carlo analyses indicate that other methods that have been proposed for dealing with the rescaling problem can lead to mistaken inferences if the error distributions are very different. In contrast, in all scenarios studied, our approach performs as least as well as, and in some cases better than, others when faced with differences in the error distributions. We present an example of our method using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study.},

SUBJECTS: A total of 4377 middle-aged, obese subjects in the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study. METHODS: The total sample was randomly split into two data subsets and psychometric testing was performed separately in each sample. Multitraitamulti-item analysis was conducted to test scaling assumptions and factor analysis was used to test the factor structure. Measures of mental well-being (MACL, HAD) were used for testing criterion-based validity. RESULTS: The Cognitive Restraint factor was consistently reproduced and scaling analysis demonstrated strong itemscale discriminant validity, while the item-scale convergent validity was unsatisfactory. The internal structure of the Disinhibition scale was weak. Most Disinhibition and Hunger items grouped in one global factor labeled Uncontrolled Eating. A third cluster containing items on Emotional Eating was also identi\textregistered ed. The obtained three-factor structure was cross-validated and replicated across subgroups by gender, age and BMI. CONCLUSION: The original TFEQ factor structure was not replicated. A short, revised 18-item instrument was constructed, representing the derived factors of Cognitive Restraint, Uncontrolled Eating and Emotional Eating. The most ef\textregistered cient items were used to boost both the convergent and discriminant validity of the scales.},

The internal consistency was satisfactory on all of the SDQ scales.Using the 90th percentile, the cut-off scores were somewhat higher than the published cut-off scores in this younger sample. Poor nutrition, low socioeconomic status and illness were found to increase the risk for mental health problems and low school performance.

Abdominal obesity, a fundamental component of the metabolic syndrome, is not defined by appropriate cutoff points for sub-Saharan Africa. Objective: To provide baseline and reference data on the anthropometry / body composition and the prevalence rates of obesity types and levels in the adult urban population of Kinshasa, DRC, Central Africa. Methods: During this cross-sectional study carried out within a random sample of adults in Kinshasa town, body mass index, waist circumference and fatty mass were measured using standard methods. Their reference and local thresholds (cut-off points) were compared with those of WHo, NCEP and ifD to define the types and levels of obesity in the population. Results: From this sample of 11 511 subjects (5 676 men and 5 835 women), the men presented with similar body mass index and fatty mass values to those of the women, but higher waist measurements. The international thresholds overestimated the prevalence of denutrition, but underscored that of general and abdominal obesity. The two types of obesity were more prevalent among women than men when using both international and local thresholds. Body mass index was negatively associated with age; but abdominal obesity was more frequent before 20 years of age and between 40 and 60 years old. local thresholds of body mass index ({$\geq$} 23, {$\geq$} 27 and {$\geq$} 30 kg/m2) and waist measurement ({$\geq$} 80, {$\geq$} 90 and {$\geq$} 94 cm) defined epidemic rates of overweight / general obesity (52\%) and abdominal obesity (40.9\%). The threshold of waist circumference {$\geq$} 94 cm (90th percentile) corresponding to the threshold of the body mass index {$\geq$} 30 kg/m2 (90th percentile) was proposed as the specific threshold of definition of the metabolic syndrome, without reference to gender, for the cities of sub-Saharan Africa. Conclusion: Further studies are required to define the optimal threshold of waist circumference in rural settings. The present local cut-off points of body mass index and waist circumference could be appropriate for the identification of Africans at risk of obesity-related disorders, and indicate the need to implement interventions to reverse increasing levels of obesity.},

Currently, several different definitions of MetS exist, causing substantial confusion as to whether they identify the same individuals or represent a surrogate of risk factors. Recently, a number of other factors besides those traditionally used to define MetS that are also linked to the syndrome have been identified. In this review, we critically consider existing definitions and evolving information, and conclude that there is still a need to develop uniform criteria to define MetS, so as to enable comparisons between different studies and to better identify patients at risk. As the application of the MetS model has not been fully validated in children and adolescents as yet, and because of its alarmingly increasing prevalence in this population, we suggest that diagnosis, prevention and treatment in this age group should better focus on established risk factors rather than the diagnosis of MetS.},

DM was defined as a personal history of the disorder or a casual glycaemia greater or equal to 200 mg/dL. Standardization according to age and sample readjustment based on the urban\textendash rural distribution of the population was applied accordance with the typical Congolese population. The probability of DM was assessed by multiple logistic regressions. Results Total prevalence of DM was 3.5\%. DM was significantly more prevalent in urban areas (age-standardized prevalence: 4.0\%) than in rural areas (1.7\%). City-dwelling DM patients were characterized by higher rates of indices of abdominal obesity (P {$<$} 0.05) whereas, in rural areas, no patients were obese. In the study group as a whole, only 25.0\% of diabetic patients were obese. On multivariate analyses, only age [adjusted OR (95\% CI): 4.79 (1.60\textendash 14.25); P = 0.004] was independently associated with the prevalence of DM, while the effect of obesity was not significant [2.64 (0.99\textendash 7.02); P = 0.051]. Conclusion Age and living in an urban environment appeared to be major determinants of DM in South Kivu. Also, obesity prevalence was relatively low in these diabetic patients, confirming the peculiar, relatively lean, phenotype of type 2 DM in indigenous sub-Saharan Africans.},

Hypertension was defined as blood pressure  {$\geq$}  140/90  mmHg. Insulin sensitivity (HOMA S;\%) was determined with the HOMA model, with insulin resistance (IR) representing HOMA S -1 and defined from HOMA S values {$<$} 50\%).

This certainly involves inadequacy in raising awareness for prevention of these diseases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the level of knowledge of the Congolese general population on hypertension and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Responses to a questionnaire from 3\% of the general population aged 15 and older in the city of Bukavu and two rural areas: Hombo and Walungu (South Kivu, eastern DRC), recruited after stratification by ward in the city of Bukavu and a group of prone villages were expected. The questions focused on identification, testing, causes, complications and treatment of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Of the 7770 respondents, screening for hypertension and diabetes mellitus affected only 14.9\% and 7.3\% of subjects respectively. Knowledge of these two conditions was generally low in the general population, although better in the subgroups of patients and those with higher socioeconomic level (P{$<$}0.05). Use of the medias was also associated with better knowledge (P{$<$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that knowledge about hypertension and diabetes mellitus and their testing in South Kivu is low. It is imperative that the Congolese government includes non-communicable diseases in its priorities of the millennium. Similarly, the WHO should actively contribute to screening for them in low-income countries.},

Despite the increased visibility of religious nongovernmental organizations working with criminalized people, research on the nongovernmental sector and criminal justice still largely focuses on secular organizations. This article argues for the conceptual importance of religion and its role shaping work in this sector, and draws from the sociology of religion to theorize the importance of discourses and practices in organizational settings. I present a typology identifying nongovernmental organizations' religious approaches, which I developed using archival, interview, and observational data from 18 nongovernmental organizations in Wisconsin. I differentiate among nongovernmental organizations that I call secular, which stay away from religion, religiously inspired, which operate based on religious principles, and reciprocally religious, which hold expectations of religious practices from program participants. Moving beyond single-case studies enables a comparative analysis of the ideas and practices among actors that serve and seek to shape people leaving prison, whose work varies in terms of predominant denominations, assumptions about morality and sin, and relationships with churches and the medical profession. The results encourage further inquiry into what religious nongovernmental organizations do, why, and how, given the distinctive discursive and material resources and practices that they bring into work with criminalized people.},

  abstract = {It is generally agreed that social ties play a beneficial role in the maintenance of psychological well-being. In this targeted review, we highlight four sets of insights that emerge from the literature on social ties and mental health outcomes (defined as stress reactions, psychological well-being, and psychological distress, including depressive symptoms and anxiety). First, the pathways by which social networks and social supports influence mental health can be described by two alternative (although not mutually exclusive) causal models\textemdash the main effect model and the stress-buffering model. Second, the protective effects of social ties on mental health are not uniform across groups in society. Gender differences in support derived from social network participation may partly account for the higher prevalence of psychological distress among women compared to men. Social connections may paradoxically increase levels of mental illness symptoms among women with low resources, especially if such connections entail role strain associated with obligations to provide social support to others. Third, egocentric networks are nested within a broader structure of social relationships. The notion of social capital embraces the embeddedness of individual social ties within the broader social structure. Fourth, despite some successes reported in social support interventions to enhance mental health, further work is needed to deepen our understanding of the design, timing, and dose of interventions that work, as well as the characteristics of individuals who benefit the most.},

  abstract = {Growing inequality has heightened awareness of those at the top of the income and wealth distributions, and researchers are beginning to acknowledge the need for a way to identify top households that simultaneously accounts for their income and net worth. We contribute to the literatures on top income and wealth households by introducing a measure of top status that includes a larger number of affluent households and that explicitly accounts for the interrelationship between income and wealth. Our innovation is to start with both income and wealth holders and to divide the top into three groups: those who are top income only, those who are top net worth only, and those who are at the top of both distributions (the double one percent). Our results show that the top three groups are unique financially and demographically in ways that inform understanding of inequality and the processes that lead to membership in top income and wealth positions. Perhaps most importantly, our results identify those who are merely elite and those who occupy even more exclusive, or super elite, positions at the top of both the income and wealth distributions.},

This article presents updated evidence showing that both income and wealth are very highly concentrated in the United States but that the concentration of wealth, particularly financial wealth, is extremely high. We focus on the one percent of wealth owners and identify patterns in asset ownership, liabilities, and demographic traits that are relevant to sociological research. Findings show, for example, that those in the one percent have unique asset and debt portfolios that, to some extent, insulated them from the ill effects of the recent recession; however, patterns reported also highlight inheritance and suggest that mobility into the one percent is possible.

One potentially important contributing factor is family background. It is a critical determinant of attainment, and both childhood family resources and family structure vary racially. This article reports that family size during childhood contributes significantly to racial differences in adult wealth. I find that siblings strain material and nonmaterial resources during childhood and decrease adult home ownership, stock ownership, and total assets. Having extended family in the home also decreases wealth for those from intact families, but an extended family minimizes the negative effect of divorce and separation and increases wealth in disrupted families. I also find that childhood family size and family structure are related to racial differences in adult wealth accumulation trajectories, allowing whites to begin accumulating high-yield assets earlier in life. The results provide insight into the role of family background in creating and maintaining inequality, particularly racial stratification in wealth ownership.},

  abstract = {Background: The conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the deadliest since World War II. Over a decade of fighting amongst an array of armed groups has resulted in extensive human rights abuses, particularly the widespread use of sexual violence against women. Methods: Using a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed a non-random sample of 255 women attending a referral hospital and two local non-governmental organizations to characterize their experiences of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). We then conducted focus groups of 48 women survivors of SGBV to elaborate on survey findings. Quantitative and qualitative data underwent thematic and statistical analysis respectively. Findings: Of the women surveyed, 193 (75.7\%) experienced rape. Twenty-nine percent of raped women were rejected by their families and 6\% by their communities. Thirteen percent of women had a child from rape. Widowhood, husband abandonment, gang rape, and having a child from rape were significant risk factors for social rejection. Mixed methods findings show rape survivors were seen as ``contaminated'' with HIV, contributing to their isolation and over 95\% could not access prophylactic care in time. Receiving support from their husbands after rape was protective against survivors' feelings of shame and social isolation. Interpretation: Rape results not only in physical and psychological trauma, but can destroy family and community structures. Women face significant obstacles in seeking services after rape. Interventions offering long-term solutions for hyper-vulnerable women are vital, but lacking; reintegration programs on SGBV for women, men, and communities are also needed.},

This paper uses qualitative data, based on 10 focus groups with 86 women and men to better understand gendered community perspectives on SGBV and its consequences in South Kivu. We conclude that for many survivors, rape has consequences far beyond the physiological and psychological trauma associated with the attack. Respondents say sexual violence has become a societal phenomenon, in which the community isolation and shame experienced as a result of the attack become as important as concerns about the attack itself. Male focus group participants explain their own feelings of shame and anger associated with knowing their female relatives were raped. These findings highlight the complexity of community reintegration for survivors and identify a number of programmatic and policy implications, such as the need for counseling for survivors of sexual violence with their families as well as individually; the importance of income-generating training; and the need for improved justice mechanisms to bring perpetrators to justice.},

Following an anticipatory period, participants completed a speech or a speech-plus-math challenge in front of either a virtual audience, a panel of judges they were led to believe was behind a one-way mirror, or an audience comprised of confederates. An additional group that had prepared a speech was simply directed to observe the virtual audience but did not deliver the speech. Finally, a control group completed questionnaires for the duration of the experiment. Cortisol samples were obtained upon arrival to the laboratory, just before the challenge, and 15 and 30 minutes after the task. Participants also completed a measure assessing stressor appraisals of the task before and after the challenge. Anticipation of the task was associated with a modest increase of cortisol levels, and a further rise of cortisol was evident in response to the challenge. The neuroendocrine changes evoked by the virtual audience were comparable to those elicited by the imagined audience (behind the one-way mirror) but less than changes evoked by the panel of confederates. Stressor appraisals were higher post-challenge compared to those reported prior to the task; however, appraisals were similar across each group. These data suggest that VR technology may be amenable to evaluating the impact of psychosocial stressors such as the TSST.},

These flawed data have led some analysts to conclude that divorce has been stable or declining for the past three decades. Using new data from the American Community Survey and controlling for changes in the age composition of the married population, we conclude that there was actually a substantial increase in age-standardized divorce rates between 1990 and 2008. Divorce rates have doubled over the past two decades among persons over age 35. Among the youngest couples, however, divorce rates are stable or declining. If current trends continue, overall age-standardized divorce rates could level off or even decline over the next few decades. We argue that the leveling of divorce among persons born since 1980 probably reflects the increasing selectivity of marriage.},

Second, the relative importance varies with the sex and labor force status of the person under consideration. Among men in the labor force, income is the strongest predictor of distress. Among women in the labor force, education is the most important. Among homemakers, education is by far the most important aspect of SES for predicting distress. Several specifications and elaborations of these basic patterns are presented. Together these show that much more than a simple economic reality is involved in the SES-distress relationship.

Major depression is estimated in these surveys to be a commonly occurring disorder. Although estimates of lifetime prevalence and course vary substantially across countries for reasons that could involve both substantive and methodological processes, the crossnational data are clear in documenting meaningful lifetime prevalence with wide variation in age-of-onset and high risk of lifelong chronicrecurrent persistence. A number of sociodemographic correlates of major depression are found consistently across countries, and crossnational data also document associations with numerous adverse outcomes, including difficulties in role transitions (e.g., low education, high teen childbearing, marital disruption, unstable employment), reduced role functioning (e.g., low marital quality, low work performance, low earnings), elevated risk of onset, persistence and severity of a wide range of secondary disorders, and increased risk of early mortality due to physical disorders and suicide.},

  abstract = {Background: Depression is the leading cause of disease-related disability among women in the world today. Depression is much more common among women than men, with female / male risk ratios roughly 2:1. Aims: Recent epidemiological research is reviewed. Implications are suggested for needed future research. Results: The higher prevalence of depression among women than men is due to higher risk of first onset, not to differential persistence or recurrence. Although the gender difference first emerges in puberty, other experiences related to changes in sex hormones (pregnancy, menopause, use of oral contraceptives, and use of hormone replacement therapy) do not significantly influence major depression. These observations suggest that the key to understanding the higher rates of depression among women than men lies in an investigation of the joint effects of biological vulnerabilities and environmental provoking experiences. Conclusions: Advancing understanding of female depression will require future epidemiologic research to focus on first onsets and to follow incident cohorts of young people through the pubertal transition into young adulthood with fine-grained measures of both sex hormones and gender-related environmental experiences. Experimental interventions aimed at primary prevention by jointly manipulating putative biological and environmental risk factors will likely be needed to adjudicate between contending causal hypotheses regarding the separate and joint effects of interrelated risk factors.},

In our paper we demonstrate that this view is incorrect: Most prior research has assumed that the effects of race and social class are additive; our analysis shows that they are actually interactive. The form of interaction is such that the true effect of race is suppressed and the true effect of social class is magnified in a model that fails to take the interaction into consideration. An analysis of eight different epidemiologic surveys documents this result and shows that race differences in psychological distress are particularly pronounced among people with low incomes. On the basis of this result we call for renewed interest in the effect of race on mental health.},

Although more prevalent among people with disadvantaged social status, results show that perceived discrimination is common in the total population, with 33.5 percent of respondents in the total sample reporting exposure to major lifetime discrimination and 60.9 percent reporting exposure to day-to-day discrimination. The associations of perceived discrimination with mental health are comparable in magnitude to those of other more commonly studied stressors, and these associations do not vary consistently across subsamples defined on the basis of social status. Even though perceived discrimination explains only a small part of the observed associations between disadvantaged social status and mental health, given its high prevalence, wide distribution, and strong associations with mental health, perceived discrimination needs to be treated much more seriously than in the past in future studies of stress and mental health.},

We present a different argument in this paper. We hypothesize and then document that women are not pervasively more vulnerable to the effects of undesirable events. A disaggregated analysis of life-event effects shows, further, that female vulnerability is largely confined to "network" events: life events that do not occur to the focal respondent but to someone in his or her social network who is considered important. Further results are presented to argue that this greater vulnerability is due to the greater emotional involvement of women in the lives of those around them. It is demonstrated that this emotional cost of caring is responsible for a substantial part of the overall relationship between sex and distress.},

METHOD: The data came from the part II subsample (N=5,877) of the National Comorbidity Survey. The respondents completed a structured diagnostic interview that retrospectively dated age at onset of each of 14 lifetime DSM-III-R disorders and recorded ages at first marriage and divorce. These data were used to estimate survival models describing the relationships between prior disorders and subsequent divorce. In addition, simulations were used to estimate the number of years spent out of marriage because of these causal relationships in the total U.S. population. RESULTS: Prior psychiatric disorders were associated with a substantially higher risk of divorce. The simulations suggested that the effects of these associations in the U.S. population in the survey's age range are approximately 23 million lost years of marriage among men and 48 million lost years of marriage among women. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric disorders have a number of adverse consequences for those who suffer from them and for their families and communities. The results reported here suggest that an increase in the number of people who divorce and a decrease in the number of years of marriage in the population may be among them. The debate over whether society can afford to provide universal treatment for psychiatric disorders needs to take these costs into consideration. (Am J Psychiatry 1998; 155:1092\textendash 1096)},

Basing our analysis on three national surveys and two community surveys spanning the years 1957 to 1976--a period of rapid changes in the roles of women--we document a reduction in the relationship between sex and one indicator of distress, a screening scale of psychophysiological symptoms. Specification analyses show that the increased labor-force participation of women has been responsible for part of this trend. However, there appear to be no relationships between the decline in psychophysiological symptoms and changes in educational attainment, rates of marriage, marital dissolution, or childbearing.},

Data are from the Clergy Health Initiative Longitudinal Survey of United Methodist ministers in North Carolina that included the Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF) for positive mental health and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression in 2014 and 2016 (N~=~955). The promotion hypothesis predicts reduced risk of depression in 2016 among clergy whose mental health increased to flourishing and the increased risk of depression in 2016 for clergy who stayed not flourishing. The protection hypothesis predicts increased risk of depression in 2016 for clergy who were flourishing in 2014 but went down to `not flourishing' in 2016. The reference group is clergy who stayed flourishing. We used modified Poisson regression models for binary outcomes to estimate Prevalence Ratios (PR) and to estimate Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) of depression in 2016 associated with changes in mental health status. Results support both hypotheses. Compared to clergy who stayed flourishing, clergy who improved to flourishing were as likely, while clergy who stayed not flourishing were nearly seven times more likely, to have depression in 2016. Clergy who declined to not flourishing were six times more likely to have depression in 2016 compared to those who stayed flourishing. Similar patterns were observed when the sample was restricted to clergy without depression in 2014. These findings suggest focusing on MHPP as a complementary approach to treatment to reduce the incidence, prevalence and burden of depression.},

Results. Population prevalence of any of 3 mental disorders and levels of mental health appeared stable but were dynamic at the individual level. Fifty-two percent of the 17.5\% of respondents with any mental illness in 2005 were new cases; one half of those languishing in 1995 improved in 2005, and one half of those flourishing in 1995 declined in 2005.

We conducted in-depth interviews with caregivers of orphaned and separated children (OSC) in five geographic regions (Kenya; Ethiopia; Cambodia; Hyderabad, India; and Nagaland, India). Sixty-two participants answered open-ended questions including, ``What does mental health mean to you? What does it mean to be mentally healthy?'' We coded responses using a priori and data-driven codes and analyzed coded text for themes. Across regions, participants frequently articulated similar conceptualizations, which did not include orientations/values but spanned experiences, functioning, and behaviors, as well as the eudaimonic and hedonic traditions of happiness. Functioning included good states of mind (peaceful mind, thinking clearly, thinking positively) and being physically healthy. Behaviors were contributing to the community and spending enjoyable time in groups. For experiences, participants universally indicated happiness, which was the most prominent feature of good mental health, using terms such as ``happy,'' ``jovial,'' and ``joy.'' Across all geographic regions, mental health was not articulated merely as the absence of mental illness. A two continua model of good mental health emerged spontaneously among half of Kenyan and one-third of Cambodian participants. Altogether, the lay conception of `a person who is mentally healthy' across these diverse non-western cultures supports multiple existing conceptions and measurements of flourishing. Researchers may consider adding to their conceptualizations good functioning in the form of clear and peaceful thinking and the behavior of enjoyable socializing.},

  abstract = {The AIDS epidemic has created an unprecedented number of orphans. While largely absorbed by extended family, this additional responsibility can weigh heavily on their caregivers. The concept of caregiver burden captures multiple dimensions of well-being (e.g., physical, social and psychological). Measuring the extent and determinants of caregiving burden can inform the design of programmes to ease the negative consequences of caregiving. This study uses the baseline data from a study assessing interventions for orphans and vulnerable adolescents in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Orphan caregivers (n~=~726) completed an adapted version of the 12-item Zarit Burden Interview. In addition to basic caregiver and household demographics, the survey also collected information on AIDS-related illness and recent deaths. Descriptive data are presented, followed by multivariate Poisson regression models to explore factors associated with caregiver burden. Approximately 40\% of caregivers reported high levels of orphan caregiving burden. Feelings of stress and inadequacy concerning their care responsibilities as well as anger towards the child were common. Household food insecurity was the most important predictor of orphan caregiving burden (marginal effect~=~7.82;p~{$<~$}0.001 for those reporting severe hunger); income was also a significant determinant. When other AIDS impacts were added to the model, only the AIDS-related illness of the caregiver was significantly associated with burden (marginal effect~=~3.77;p~{$<~$}0.001). This study suggests that caregivers with economic vulnerability and those struggling with their own AIDS-related illness feel most overburdened. These findings are particularly relevant to service providers who must identify caregivers in need of immediate assistance and allocate limited resources effectively. To alleviate caregiver burden, programmes must foster greater economic security (e.g., by facilitating access to social grants or directly providing cash transfers) and coordinate services with home-based care programmes serving the chronically ill.},

  abstract = {Ethnographic research suggests that child mobility serves as a social risk management strategy for vulnerable, uninsured rural households. In line with this research, and as a supplement to previous empirical research on child mobility, this article suggests that child mobility is not only implemented as response to shocks and poverty, but also ex-ante such situations. That is, it is assumed that when households perceive themselves to be at heightened risk of critical poverty or shock, the likelihood of child-relocation increases. The hypothesis is tested by looking at the statistical association between child mobility and household head risk perception, operationalized as his or her level of worry about not being able to provide the family with food in the upcoming 12 months. Data from 2,078 households with eligible children in rural Benin, 2012, are analyzed. In 2010, Benin was struck by a massive flood that affected almost half the sampled households. In the OLS presented, child mobility is regressed on poverty, being shocked by the 2010 floods, and risk\textemdash understood as level of worry about the future food situation\textemdash and a set of socioeconomic controls. Household head risk perception is systematically associated with child mobility, while poverty and shock are not. If future risk perception indeed also predicts high-risk child relocations, then predictable social safety nets should be an adequate policy response.},

One approach theorizes people actively updating their beliefs and behaviors in the face of new information. The other argues that, following early socialization experiences, dispositions are stable. We formalize these two models, elaborate empirical implications of each, and derive a simple combined model for comparing them using panel data. We test this model on 183 attitude and behavior items from the 2006 to 2014 rotating panels of the General Social Survey. The pattern of results is complex but more consistent with the settled dispositions model than with the active updating model. Most of the observed change in the GSS appears to be short-term attitude change or measurement error rather than persisting changes. When persistent change occurs, it is somewhat more likely to occur in younger people and for public behaviors and beliefs about high-profile issues than for private attitudes. We argue that we need both models in our theory of cultural evolution but that we need more research on the circumstances under which each is more likely to apply.},

Results: The original three-factor model was superior over other competing factor models. Investigation of the second-order factor model supported the presence of the common burnout factor and indicated depersonalization and emotional exhaustion were core components of burnout. Longitudinal factorial invariance was not achieved for personal accomplishment. Conclusion: The findings suggest the applicability of the MBI in a longitudinal research with careful inference regarding personal accomplishment and highlight the importance of depersonalization in social worker burnout.},

During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities.

This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. Methods Term searches in the Web of Science\textregistered, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. Results In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal. Conclusion In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress.},

The 'Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) mainly consists of an anticipation period (10 min) and a test period (10 min) in which the subjects have to deliver a free speech and perform mental arithmetic in front of an audience. In six independent studies this protocol has been found to induce considerable changes in the concentration of ACTH, cortisol (serum and saliva), GH, prolactin as well as significant increases in heart rate. As for salivary cortisol levels, the TSST reliably led to 2- to 4-fold elevations above baseline with similar peak cortisol concentrations. Studies are summarized in which TSST-induced cortisol increases elucidated some of the multiple variables contributing to the interindividual variation in adrenocortical stress responses. The results suggest that gender, genetics and nicotine consumption can influence the individual's stress responsiveness to psychological stress while personality traits showed no correlation with cortisol responses to TSST stimulation. From these data we conclude that the TSST can serve as a tool for psychobiological research.},

Teachers, nurses, lawyers, mental health workers, student affairs professionals also leave at high rates during the beginning years of a career. The present study is an attempt to understand some of the influences on decisions to persist or quit. Using the construct of perceived fit (Kristoff-Brown \& Billsberry, 2013), I explored the career trajectories of nine graduates who persisted in ministry and eight graduates who left ministry. Perceived fit was complex but influenced decisions about whether or not to accept an initial assignment. Persistence in an assignment was shaped by the meaningfulness of work. The goal was to discover how life experiences contributed to the ways seminary graduates thought about ministry during an at-risk career phase. Key life experiences included mentoring, seminary faculty relationships, laboratories, self-care strategies, and managing student loan debt. Other important findings included the role of early church experiences, college leader interaction, the need for supportive organizational cultures, and a reimagination of the ministry license process. There were key differences between graduates who persisted in ministry and graduates who left ministry. Two key differences were the early clarification of call and personal initiative. Furthermore, this study provides a context for future discussions related to the cost of a graduate education, future career decisions available to seminary graduates, and the burden of school debt on the decision-making processes of ministers. This study suggests seminaries should consider providing financial literacy training to all students, include a more realistic picture of potential income as a pastor, and give greater attention to encouraging personal initiative in ministry training and development. Additionally, seminaries should consider broadening the scope of theological education to include persons who are not pursuing pastoral ministry.},

Design: Prospective cohort study. Baseline examination in 1973 determined cases of cardiovascular disease, behavioural and biological risks, and stressful characteristics of work. Biological risks were measured at 5 year and 10 year follow up. Setting: Staff of a company in the metal industry in Finland. Participants: 812 employees (545 men, 267 women) who were free from cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Main outcome measure: Cardiovascular mortality 1973-2001 from the national mortality register. Results: Mean length of follow up was 25.6 years. After adjustment for age and sex, employees with high job strain, a combination of high demands at work and low job control, had a 2.2-fold (95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.2) cardiovascular mortality risk compared with their colleagues with low job strain. The corresponding risk ratio for employees with effort-reward imbalance (low salary, lack of social approval, and few career opportunities relative to efforts required at work) was 2.4 (1.3 to 4.4). These ratios remained significant after additional adjustment for occupational group and biological and behavioural risks at baseline. High job strain was associated with increased serum total cholesterol at the 5 year follow up. Effort-reward imbalance predicted increased body mass index at the 10 year follow up. Conclusions: High job strain and effort-reward imbalance seem to increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality. The evidence from industrial employees suggests that attention should be paid to the prevention of work stress.},

  abstract = {The present study experimentally tested the crossstressor adaptation hypothesis by examining whether endurance exercise training leads to reductions in the physiological stress response to a psychosocial stressor. We randomly assigned 149 healthy men to a 12-week exercise training, relaxation training, or a wait list control group. Before and after intervention we assessed the groups' physical fitness (lactate testing) and compared their physiological stress responses to the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups in terms of salivary free cortisol, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV); the final sample consisted of 96 subjects. As hypothesized, the exercise training significantly improved fitness and reduced stress reactivity in all three parameters; however, it only improved stress recovery in terms of HR. The relaxation program reduced only cortisol, but not HR or HRV reactivity; no changes emerged for the control group. The findings suggest that the cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis is valid for cardiovascular as well as endocrine stress reactivity.},

This article examines the portfolio of bank accounts held by same-sex and different-sex couples and its relationship to bargaining power and individual and relationship characteristics. Data from the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances suggest that married couples are much more likely to hold money jointly than are same-sex or unmarried different-sex couples, even after accounting for the effects of other characteristics. However, many couples of all types hold money in joint accounts and do so more often in longer term relationships and when rearing children. Proxies for bargaining power help predict whether money will be held in individual accounts for unmarried different-sex and same-sex couples, but not for married couples. These patterns could reflect greater matching of married couples on preferences or the effects of legal and social institutions that differ by marital status and sexual orientation.},

To test the hypothesis that HR variability is a predictor of long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the Holter tapes of 808 patients who survived AMI were analyzed. Heart rate variability was defined as the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals in a 24-hour continuous electrocardiogram recording made 11 {$\pm$} 3 days after AMI. In all patients demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were measured at baseline. Mean follow-up time was 31 months. Of all Holter variables measured, HR variability had the strongest univariate correlation with mortality. The relative risk of mortality was 5.3 times higher in the group with HR variability of less than 50 ms than the group with HR variability of more than 100 ms. HR variability remained a significant predictor of mortality after adjusting for clinical, demographic, other Holter features and ejection fraction. A hypothesis to explain this finding is that decreased HR variability correlates with increased sympathetic or decreased vagal tone, which may predispose to ventricular fibrillation.},

This study aims to assess the psychological and physical impact on health and social care staff working with an identified sex-trafficked population in a Northern City within England and identify methods to assist staff to manage this complex population. Methods: This research is a qualitative study of 12 members of health and social care staff through semi-structured interviews. The subjects were identified using purposive sampling, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Staff found working with sex-trafficked populations more difficult than with other vulnerable groups. They frequently described burnout and other adverse effects on their psychological and physical health. In general, staff felt undersupported and undertrained by their organizations. This led to concerns about the quality and sustainability of the service. Conclusions: Working with victims of sex trafficking significantly impacts on the physical and psychological health of staff. Staff working with such vulnerable groups require training and high levels of support to ensure that they are not adversely affected by their work and to ensure that high quality services are maintained. Practices to promote occupational health must be instilled within workplace policy and the organizational culture to limit the impact on psychological and physical health in staff working with vulnerable populations.},

Analyses using data from roughly 2000 work establishments confirm that the relationship between organizational practices and out-group hiring, the hiring of applicants not like a hiring agent in terms of race and/or sex, is not simple. Findings imply that the mechanisms linking race and sex out-groups to jobs differ, so certain formal organizational practices will only partly reduce differences in hiring outcomes across race\textendash sex groups. The effects of employee referral use, soft skill screens, skill requirements, and a job\~Os starting wage on out-group hires differ for female and male hiring agents. These results suggest that sex differences in social networks and women\~Os and men\~Os different location on employers\~O labor queues influence the hiring process.},

We analyze data on 63 American religiously based organizations and denominational agencies that provide emergency relief and long-term economic development services to people and communities in other countries. We find that differences in religious tradition make very little difference in the size of programs or in the actual program activities. The most significant difference between religious traditions is in how they publicly legitimate their activity to their constituents. For example, analysis of mission statements and program descriptions indicates that, in the explicit justifications for their activities, evangelical groups face different ideological tasks than mainline Protestant and ecumenical organizations. More subtle legitimations occur in how tasks are defined in organizational structure and budget accounting categories. Here, mainline Protestant and ecumenical groups are the most likely to draw sharp distinctions between "religious" church extension programs and "secular" relief and development activity, while evangelical organizations are more likely to blur such boundaries.},

In 2004, Foundation RamaLevina (FORAL), a Congolese health and social non-governmental organization, started a mobile health program for vulnerable women and men to address the barriers to access identified by GBV survivors and their families in rural South Kivu province, Eastern DRC. FORAL conducted a case study of the implementation of this program between July 2010-June 2011 in 6 rural villages. The case study engaged FORAL staff, partner health care providers, community leaders and survivors in developing and implementing a revised strategy with the goal of improving and sustaining health services. The case study focused on: (1) Expansion of mobile clinic services and visit schedule; (2) Clinical monitoring and evaluation system; and (3) Recognition, documentation and brief psychosocial support for symptoms suggestive of anxiety, depression and PTSD. During this period, FORAL treated 772 women of which 85\% reported being survivors of sexual violence. Almost half of the women (45\%) reported never receiving health services after the last sexual assault. The majority of survivors reported symptoms consistent with STI. Male partner adherence to STI treatment was low (41\%). The case study demonstrated areas of strengths in FORAL's program, including improved access to health care by survivors and their male partner, enhanced quality of health education and facilitated regular monitoring, follow-up care and referrals. In addition, three critical areas were identified by FORAL that needed further development: provision of health services to young, unmarried women in a way that reduces possibility of future stigma, engaging male partners in health education and clinical care and strengthening linkages for referral of survivors and their partners to psychosocial support and mental health services. FORAL's model of offering health education to all community members, partnering with local providers to leverage resources and their principal of avoiding labeling the clinic as one for survivors will help women and their families in the DRC and other conflict settings to comfortably and safely access needed health care services.},

  abstract = {Background: Burnout is a psychological syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, feelings of cynicism and reduced personal accomplishment. In the past years there has been disagreement on whether burnout and depression are the same or different constructs, as they appear to share some common features (e.g. loss of interest and impaired concentration). However, the results so far are inconclusive and researchers disagree with regard to the degree to which we should expect such overlap. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between burnout and depression. Additionally, given that burnout is the result of chronic stress and that working environments can often trigger anxious reactions, we also investigated the relationship between burnout and anxiety. Method: We searched the online databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed) and Google Scholar for studies examining the relationship between burnout and depression and burnout and anxiety, which were published between January 2007 and August 2018. Inclusion criteria were used for all studies and included all types of studies (cross-sectional and longitudinal), published and unpublished research articles, full-text articles, articles written in the English language, studies that present the effects sizes of their findings and that used reliable research tools. Results: Our results showed a significant association between burnout and depression (r = 0.520, SE = 0.012, 95\% CI = 0.492, 0.547) and burnout and anxiety (r = 0.460, SE = 0.014, 95\% CI = 0.421, 0.497). However, moderation analysis for both burnout - depression and burnout - anxiety relationships revealed that the studies in which the MBI test was used and were rated as having poorer quality showed lower effect sizes. Conclusions: Our research aims to clarify the relationship between burnout - depression and burnout - anxiety relationships. Our findings revealed no conclusive overlap between burnout and depression and burnout and anxiety, indicating that they are different and robust constructs. Future studies should focus on utilizing more longitudinal designs in order to assess the causal relationships between these variables.},

PCTs can be designed in several different ways, and the selection should be driven by the clinical question posed. PCTs also fall towards the pragmatic endpoint of the explanatory/ pragmatic clinical trial continuum, suggesting that they may more favorably influence clinical decision-making in real-world contexts. Researchers often want to know not what is the best treatment irrespective of choice and compliance, but whether an intervention can work for the patients who choose it. If we want to answer the latter question, we must let patients choose.},

  abstract = {The objective of this article is to compare demographic characteristics, risk behaviors, and service utilization among injection drug users (IDUs) recruited from two separate studies in San Francisco in 2005, one which used targeted sampling (TS) and the other which used respondent-driven sampling (RDS). IDUs were recruited using TS (n=651) and RDS (n=534) and participated in quantitative interviews that included demographic characteristics, risk behaviors, and service utilization. Prevalence estimates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess whether there were differences in these variables by sampling method. There was overlap in 95\% CIs for all demographic variables except African American race (TS: 45\%, 53\%; RDS: 29\%, 44\%). Maps showed that the proportion of IDUs distributed across zip codes were similar for the TS and RDS sample, with the exception of a single zip code that was more represented in the TS sample. This zip code includes an isolated, predominantly African American neighborhood where only the TS study had a field site. Risk behavior estimates were similar for both TS and RDS samples, although self-reported hepatitis C infection was lower in the RDS sample. In terms of service utilization, more IDUs in the RDS sample reported no recent use of drug treatment and syringe exchange program services. Our study suggests that perhaps a hybrid sampling plan is best suited for recruiting IDUs in San Francisco, whereby the more intensive ethnographic and secondary analysis components of TS would aid in the planning of seed placement and field locations for RDS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ``0'' (not at all) to ``3'' (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, selfreported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score !10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

Satisficing may lead respondents to employ a variety of response strategies, including choosing the first response alternative that seems to constitute a reasonable answer, agreeing with an assertion made by a question, endorsing the status quo instead of endorsing social change, failing to differentiate among a set of diverse objects in ratings, saying `don't know' instead of reporting an opinion, and randomly choosing among the response alternatives offered. This paper specifies a wide range of factors that are likely to encourage satisficing,and reviews relevant evidence evaluating these speculations.

Due to self-presentation concerns, survey respondents underreport socially undesirable activities and overreport socially desirable ones. This article reviews theoretical explanations of socially motivated misreporting in sensitive surveys and provides an overview of the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of specific survey methods designed to encourage the respondents to answer more honestly. Besides psychological aspects, like a stable need for social approval and the preference for not getting involved into embarrassing social interactions, aspects of the survey design, the interviewer's characteristics and the survey situation determine the occurrence and the degree of social desirability bias. The review shows that survey designers could generate more valid data by selecting appropriate data collection strategies that reduce respondents' discomfort when answering to a sensitive question.},

These questions have been traditionally addressed by null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). NHST has deep problems that are solved by Bayesian data analysis. As psychologists transition to Bayesian data analysis, it is natural to ask how Bayesian analysis assesses null values. The article explains and evaluates two different Bayesian approaches. One method involves Bayesian model comparison (and uses Bayes factors). The second method involves Bayesian parameter estimation and assesses whether the null value falls among the most credible values. Which method to use depends on the specific question that the analyst wants to answer, but typically the estimation approach (not using Bayes factors) provides richer information than the model comparison approach.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the potential for attrition bias and panel conditioning in a longitudinal online election panel survey. The 2008 Associated Press-Yahoo! News Poll was conducted by Knowledge Networks with contributions from political scientists at Harvard University and Stanford University. The study involved an eleven-wave Web panel election survey of general population U.S. adults. All the interviews were conducted with KnowledgePanel\textregistered{} respondents. Our assessment of panel conditioning is made possible by the study's sample design, which includes both the longitudinal sample component as well as three separate fresh cross-sectional samples. We examined the potential for the impact of panel conditioning on self-reports of certain attitudes, preferences, and behaviors such as the propensity to remain undecided and to report being certain about voting or having voted early. We employ Extended Cox hazard modeling to estimate risk factors responsible for attrition from the panel study. We found some evidence of panel conditioning for one political knowledge question. Not surprisingly, longitudinal respondents were more likely to correctly name Obama's religion than cross-sectional respondents, confirming previous results from the literature for panel conditioning on knowledge questions. For the other seven items about the presidential election, only two showed some evidence of panel conditioning. Regarding panel attrition, the rare (i.e., non-whites, adults ages 18 to 29, or less than high school education) and non-rare respondent groups were attriting from the panel at the same rate during the first four waves, probably due to a specific incentive system put in place for the rare respondents. Undecided Republicans were more likely to quit the panel during the first four waves than Republicans who chose John McCain. In subsequent waves, late-participating respondents were more likely to drop from the study than early respondents in both rare and non-rare groups.},

This Series paper summarises evidence regarding the epidemiology on gender differences in prevalence, incidence, and course of depression, and factors possibly explaining the gender gap. Gender-related subtypes of depression are suggested to exist, of which the developmental subtype has the strongest potential to contribute to the gender gap. Limited evidence exists for risk factors to be specifically linked to depression. Future research could profit from a transdiagnostic perspective, permitting the differentiation of specific susceptibilities from those predicting general psychopathologies within and across the internalising and externalising spectra. An integration of the Research Domain Criteria framework will allow examination of gender differences in core psychological functions, within the context of developmental transitions and environmental settings. Monitoring of changing socioeconomic and cultural trends in factors contributing to the gender gap will be important, as well as the influence of these trends on changes in symptom expression across psychopathologies in men and women.},

However, it is well known that CLPMs can lead to different parameter estimates depending on the time-interval of observation. Consequently, this can lead to researchers drawing conflicting conclusions regarding the sign and/or dominance of relationships. Multiple authors have suggested the use of continuous-time models to address this issue.In this article, we demonstrate the exact circumstances under which such conflicting conclusions occur. Specifically, we show that such conflicts are only avoided in general in the case of bivariate, stable, nonoscillating, first-order systems, when comparing models with uniform time-intervals between observations. In addition, we provide a range of tools, proofs, and guidelines regarding the comparison of discrete- and continuous-time parameter estimates.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of the different combinations of factors that make up the metabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program and to examine their association with all-cause mortality in younger and older men and women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \textemdash{} A total of 2,784 men and 3,240 women from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with public-access mortality data linkage (follow-up ϭ 14.2 Ϯ 0.2 years) were studied. RESULTS \textemdash{} Metabolic syndrome was present in 26\% of younger (aged Յ65 years) and 55.0\% of older (aged Ͼ65 years) participants. The most prevalent metabolic syndrome combination was the clustering of high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure in younger men (4.8\%) and triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and elevated waist circumference in younger women (4.2\%). The presence of all five metabolic syndrome factors was the most common metabolic syndrome combination in both older men (8.0\%) and women (9.2\%). Variation existed in how metabolic syndrome combinations were associated with mortality. In younger adults, having all five metabolic syndrome factors was most strongly associated with mortality risk, whereas in older men, none of metabolic syndrome combinations were associated with mortality. In older women, having elevated glucose or low HDL as one of the metabolic syndrome components was most strongly associated with mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} Metabolic syndrome is a heterogeneous entity with age and sex variation in component clusters that may have important implications for interpreting the association between metabolic syndrome and mortality risk. Thus, metabolic syndrome used as a whole may mask important differences in assessing health and mortality risk.},

However, we still have a limited understanding of how various HIV impacts\textemdash including caregiver's own HIV illness, responsibilities of caring for a child orphaned by AIDS, or both\textemdash affect psychological outcomes among caregivers. Furthermore, few studies have explored the relationship between stigma, HIV, and psychological outcomes among caregivers of children in HIV-endemic communities. A cross-sectional survey conducted from 2009 to 2010 assessed anxiety among 2477 caregivers of children in HIV-endemic South Africa. Chi-square tested differences in anxiety among caregivers living with HIV, caregivers of a child orphaned by AIDS, and caregivers affected with both conditions. Multivariate logistic regressions identified whether the relationship between HIV impacts and anxiety remained after controlling for socio-demographic co-factors. Mediation analysis tested the relationship between stigma, HIV, and anxiety. The odds of meeting threshold criteria for clinically relevant anxiety symptoms were two and a half times greater among caregivers living with HIV compared to nonaffected caregivers. The odds of meeting threshold criteria for clinically relevant anxiety symptoms were greatest among caregivers living with HIV and caring for a child orphaned by AIDS. Exposure to AIDS-related stigma partially mediated the relationship between HIV and anxiety. Interventions are needed to address caregiver psychological health, particularly among caregivers affected with both conditions of living with HIV and caring for a child orphaned by AIDS.},

Results from the adult sample of 448 Christians, Muslims and Traditionalists showed significant negative correlations between depression, psychological wellness and spirituality. Qualitative responses revealed that while spiritual interventions for mental disorders was most frequently stated, a large number of responses favored psychological interventions as treatment options as well.

  abstract = {Psychophysiological research integrating heart rate variability (HRV) has increased during the last two decades, particularly given the fact that HRV is able to index cardiac vagal tone. Cardiac vagal tone, which represents the contribution of the parasympathetic nervous system to cardiac regulation, is acknowledged to be linked with many phenomena relevant for psychophysiological research, including selfregulation at the cognitive, emotional, social, and health levels. The ease of HRV collection and measurement coupled with the fact it is relatively affordable, noninvasive and pain free makes it widely accessible to many researchers. This ease of access should not obscure the difficulty of interpretation of HRV findings that can be easily misconstrued, however, this can be controlled to some extent through correct methodological processes. Standards of measurement were developed two decades ago by a Task Force within HRV research, and recent reviews updated several aspects of the Task Force paper. However, many methodological aspects related to HRV in psychophysiological research have to be considered if one aims to be able to draw sound conclusions, which makes it difficult to interpret findings and to compare results across laboratories. Those methodological issues have mainly been discussed in separate outlets, making difficult to get a grasp on them, and thus this paper aims to address this issue. It will help to provide psychophysiological researchers with recommendations and practical advice concerning experimental designs, data analysis, and data reporting. This will ensure that researchers starting a project with HRV and cardiac vagal tone are well informed regarding methodological considerations in order for their findings to contribute to knowledge advancement in their field.},

The present study sought to contribute to the present literature by investigating differences on personality traits among men and women who identified as either religious only (R), spiritual only (S), both spiritual and religious (B), or neither spiritual nor religious (N). One thousand thirty-seven (1037) adults (M age\,=\,36.34, SD\,=\,12.62) participated online via Amazon's Mechanical Turk as part of a larger study and completed the IPIP-NEO-120, Spiritual Transcendence Scale, Duke University Religion Index, and demographic information. Results revealed that men were more likely to identify as R and N than women, and women were more likely to identify as B than men. Women showed more significant differences among Big Five traits than men. Compared to other women, R-women reported the lowest levels of Openness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, and highest levels of Extraversion. N-women reported the highest levels of Neuroticism, while S-women reported highest Openness. Among men, R-men reported the lowest Openness, and S-men reported the highest Openness. B-men reported higher Extraversion than N-men. Additionally, Big Five traits appeared to account for significantly more variance in self-reported religiousness for women than men. Implications of these findings and recommendations for future research are provided and discussed.},

The present study examined psychological and physiological stress responses in adult ADHD subjects in comparison to healthy controls under laboratory conditions. Thirty-six subjects (18 patients with DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis, 18 sex- and age-matched healthy controls) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum, C., Pirke, K.-M., Hellhammer, D.H., 1993. The "Trier Social Stress Test"--a tool for investigating psychobiological stress responses in a laboratory setting. Neuropsychobiology 28, 76-81), a standardized psychosocial stress protocol which contains a stress anticipation phase and a stress phase with a free speech assignment and subsequent performance of a mental arithmetic. Physiological stress measures were salivary cortisol as an indicator of the HPA axis, heart rate (HR), and time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Subjective stress experience was measured via self-report repeatedly throughout the experimental session. In line with previous theoretical and empirical work in the field of childhood ADHD, it was hypothesized that the ADHD and control group would exhibit comparable baseline levels in all dependent variables. For ADHD subjects, we expected attenuated responses of the physiological parameters during anticipation and presence of the standardized stressor, but elevated subjective stress ratings. Hypotheses were confirmed for the baseline condition. Consistent with our assumptions in regard to the psychological stress response, the ADHD group experienced significantly greater subjective stress. The results for the physiological variables were mixed. While ADHD subjects revealed an attenuated HR during the stress phase, no significant group differences were found for the other parameters, although a trend was observed for both the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio of the HRV power spectral analysis and salivary cortisol (the latter possibly indicating generally lower cortisol levels in ADHD subjects). In summary, the present findings are the first to demonstrate a significant alteration of a specific physiological stress measure (HR) and, more clearly, of psychological aspects of the stress response in adults suffering from ADHD. In regard to the physiological stress response, it is recommended that future studies employ larger sample sizes and a more comprehensive range of physiological stress parameters. Additionally, the issue of transferability of laboratory results to real life stressors needs to be addressed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate trends in body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of obesity among adults in Finland from 1982 to 1997, and to identify population groups with increasing obesity. SUBJECTS: Random samples from the national population register including men and women aged 25 {$\pm$} 64 y (n  24604, total). DESIGN: Four cross-sectional surveys carried out in three areas in Finland every \textregistered fth year since 1982. MEASUREMENTS: Weight and height were measured, and data on occupation and education level were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean BMI increased in both genders. In men, the upward trend was greatest (the increase of 1.3 kgam2 in 15 y) in the oldest age group (55 {$\pm$} 64 y), and was found also (the increase of 0.6 kgam2) in the youngest age group (25 {$\pm$} 34 y), whereas in women, the upward trend was most prominent (the increase of 0.9 kgam2) in the youngest age group. BMI increased in all educational groups in men, but in women the upward trend seemed to be greatest in the lowest educational group. The upward trends were most prominent among retired and unemployed men, while in women changes in BMI were similar in all occupational groups. CONCLUSION: The strongest upward trend in BMI was found in the oldest men, in the youngest age group in both genders and, in particular, among men who were outside the labor force. Education is still a strong determinant of obesity, especially in women, although the social gradient in BMI has not widened in the 1990s.},

Yet this explanation has difficulty accounting for the often-observed main effects between support and mental health. Relational regulation theory (RRT) hypothesizes that main effects occur when people regulate their affect, thought, and action through ordinary yet affectively consequential conversations and shared activities, rather than through conversations about how to cope with stress. This regulation is primarily relational in that the types of people and social interactions that regulate recipients are mostly a matter of personal taste. RRT operationally defines relationships quantitatively, permitting the clean distinction between relationships and recipient personality. RRT makes a number of new predictions about social support, including new approaches to intervention.},

The current gold standard is the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR), considered more sensitive because its development incorporated newer theoretical and empirical understanding of SDR and more sophisticated multivariate techniques. We compare the efficacy of these measures with surprising results: the MCSDS consistently outperforms the BIDR in identifying fakers.

Methods{$\quad$} Eight hundred four priests in the Norwegian Church completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Effort\textendash Reward Imbalance Questionnaire (ERI-Q), and the Intrinsic Effort Scale, measuring overcommitment. Results{$\quad$} A significant proportion of the priests (23.4\%) had HADS scores indicating a possible anxiety problem. Somewhat fewer had depression problems (9.3\%). Both anxiety and depression difficulties were associated with an imbalance between effort given and rewards received at work. Priests characterized by a combination of this imbalance and high scores on overcommitment had more anxiety and depression symptoms. Conclusions{$\quad$} There is a higher occurrence of mental health challenges among priests than among the regular population. This applies in particular to anxiety symptoms measured by the HADS. These findings also indicate that it may be fruitful to explore mental health conditions among priests who report different combinations of effort\textendash reward and overcommitment.},

We found that for respondents in each race/ethnic group, patients who had a choice in the selection of their physician were more likely to be race concordant. Whites were more likely to be race concordant with their physician compared to African American, Hispanic, and Asian American respondents. Among each race/ethnic group, respondents who were race concordant reported greater satisfaction with their physician compared with respondents who were not race concordant.

  abstract = {The transfer of psychiatric care from the institution to the community has presented community structures including faith-based organisations (FBOs) with an additional burden of care. In recent years there has been an increasing policy interest among government departments, public and non-statutory agencies for the inclusion of FBOs as partners in health and welfare services. However, despite their long historical involvement in healing and healthcare, clergy are seldom viewed by mental health professionals as partners in healing and restitution but with suspicion [Koenig, 1988. Handbook of Religion and Mental Health San Diego: Academic Press; Larson, Hohmann, \& Kessler, 1988. The couch and the cloth: The need for linkage. Hospital and Community Psychiatry, 39, 1064\textendash 1069]. This may be compounded by ignorance about mental health care provision within FBOs in the UK and the preparedness, confidence and willingness to undertake such care. This paper is based on a study which examined clergy contact with people with mental illness. Thirty-two interviews were conducted with male clergy (Christian ministers, rabbis, and imams) most of whom were London-based. We examine barriers and dilemmas for clergy in caring for people with mental illness. We found that they play an important but often confined role the scale and impact of which is not recognised by their central organisation and training bodies. Low confidence about managing psychiatric problems, underscored by anxiety, fear and stereotyped attitudes to mental illness restrain their willingness to formalise their function. We argue that any proposed extension of clergy involvement in mental health will require further research and thorough deliberation by mental health services and religious organisations.},

This paper presents findings related to clergy explanatory models of mental illness and, in particular, how the social factors involved in causation are tinged with spiritual influences and implications, and how the meanings of mental distress assume a social and moral significance in distinctive localised matters.},

In the UK these barriers can be attributed, generally, to a lack of training on mental health problems and minimal collaboration with health services.

Survey data from informal caregivers to a spouse with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 200) were analyzed to observe the relationships among three variables: (1) care-related stress, (2) religiosity, and (3) depression. This sample, which has a mean age of 73 years, demonstrates high rates of self-described religiosity, church attendance and frequency of prayer. Using these criteria, women and racial/ethnic minority caregivers are the most religious. In a series of multivariate analyses, we found strong evidence to suggest that there is an expansion of care-related stressors leading to depression in this sample. Religiosity, as measured here, appears to be largely unrelated to stress and stress expansion. We found no evidence to suggest that it moderates stress expansion. However, these data do suggest that one stressor\textemdash feelings of role overload\textemdash is correlated with greater levels of self-perceived religiosity, which among caregivers who have health problems of their own is associated with greater depressive symptomatology. Thus, for a sub-sample of these caregivers, we find weak evidence of a mediation effect wherein one subjective, non-organizational dimension of religiosity is a conduit of the harmful effects of stress (rather than a suppressor). Results and data limitations are discussed in relation to better assessing the role of religiosity and spirituality in the experience of the stress process.},

Second, although RCS designs contain information that allows both aggregate- and individual-level analyses, available methods\textemdash from pooled ordinary least squares to PCSTS to time series\textemdash force researchers to choose one level of analysis. The PCSTS tool kit does not provide an appropriate solution, and we offer one here: double filtering with ARFIMA methods to account for autocorrelation in longer RCS followed by the use of multilevel modeling to estimate both aggregate- and individual-level parameters simultaneously. We use Monte Carlo experiments and three applied examples to explore the advantages of our framework.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine contributing factors relating to burnout in United Methodist Clergy. The approach for examining factors is multi-faceted and includes variables relating to leadership style, resilience, and a variety of psychosocial factors in the workplace. Brief demographic information is also examined to determine if there is any variance in various populations represented in the study. One hundred and thirty ordained clergy currently serving in the United Methodist Church completed a series of online surveys including the Authentic Leadership Questionnaire (ALQ), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ-III), and the Francis Burnout Inventory (FBI). The results from these surveys were examined using multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis in order to determine which factors, if any, are significant predictors of burnout. The results indicate that six factors were significant in predicting emotional exhaustion including meaning of work, work-life conflict, role conflict, self-awareness, horizontal trust, and general health. Discriminant analysis confirmed four of the six variables indicating significant relationships with meaning of work, role conflict, work-life conflict, and horizontal trust. Likewise, five factors were determined to be significant in predicting satisfaction in ministry including meaning of work, role conflict, resilience, organizational justice, and sense of community. Discriminant analysis for satisfaction in ministry indicated just three factors for satisfaction in ministry including meaning of work, illegitimate tasks, and general health.},

Given the more accepting attitudes of younger Americans, generational replacement is one widely noted engine of change. However, the pace of shifts in public attitudes has been too rapid for this to be the sole explanation. Identifying other causes of increasing support has been difficult due to reliance on cross-sectional associations. Using nationally representative panel data from 2008 to 2016, we test three potential explanations for changes in public attitudes toward gay marriage. Our findings suggest that increased interpersonal contact with gays and lesbians, declining religiosity, and increasing levels of education in the U.S. all contributed to the rise in public support for same-sex marriage.},

  abstract = {Background. Previous surveys on depression in China focused on prevalence estimates without providing a detailed epidemiological profile. Method. Face-to-face household interviews were conducted with a multi-stage household probability sample of 2633 adults (age o18 years) in Beijing and 2568 in Shanghai between November 2001 and February 2002. The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess major depressive episode (MDE) according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria. Results. The lifetime prevalence and 1-year prevalence estimates of DSM-IV/CIDI MDE were 3.6 \% [95 \% confidence interval (CI) 2.8\textendash 4.4 \%] and 1.8 \% (95 \% CI 1.2\textendash 2.4 \%) respectively. No significant gender difference was found in these estimates. Respondents born in 1967 or later were at elevated lifetime risk compared with respondents born in earlier cohorts. The mean age of onset was 30.3 years. Among those reporting 1-year MDE, 15.7, 51.8, 25.3 and 6.4 \% reported mild, moderate, severe and very severe symptoms respectively ; 4.8, 2.6 and 3.2 \% reported suicidal ideation, plans, and recent attempts in the same year respectively. Respondents with 1-year MDE reported a mean of 27.5 days out of role owing to their depression in the year before interview. Significant co-morbidity was found between MDE and other mental disorders [odds ratio (OR) 22.0] and chronic physical disorders (OR 3.2). Only 22.7 \% of respondents with 1-year MDE sought treatment. Conclusions. The low prevalence and insignificant gender difference, but not patterns of onset, course, co-morbidity, and impairment, distinguish the epidemiological profile of MDE in metropolitan China from those in other countries.},

Worship patterns that actively involved youth in reading, praying, and sharing their religious experience were rated as more meaningful and interesting and were associated with higher levels of Active Faith (a factor score). Youth in families with worship patterns that did not actively involve the youth were even lower on Active Faith than youth whose families had no worship. However, No Worship youth were highest on Materialism/Legalism and Alcohol/Drug Use. With one exception, worship patterns with high youth involvement were associated with lower Alcohol/Drug Use and lower Materialism/Legalism.

The model is presented as a step toward recognizing the rich diversity of social contact occurring in health service settings. The results were consistent with expectations that burnout would be higher for workers who communicated extensively regarding work, but maintained relatively few informal, supportive relationships with cowork ers. The model included job satisfaction in conjunction with the communication variables as predictors of burnout. The results are discussed as having relevance to the development of peer supervision procedures in mental health settings. Methods of clarifying departures from the model are discussed.},

Resources from both work setting and family were found to be related to subsequent levels of burnout at a 6-month interval. A LISREL model testing procedure provided support for the hypothesis that each resource area, family, work setting, and coping style, was independently related to changes in burnout over time. Each of the three aspects of psychological burnout showed a distinct relationship with the resource measures. Emotional exhaustion was related only to family resources, while depersonalization was related to both work-setting and family resources. Diminished personal accomplishment was not related to family resources, but was related to both work-setting resources and coping styles. The implications of the results for including family coping in a model of burnout and occupational stress are discussed.},

Hence, the identification of individual difference variables that predict variations in HPA-axis activity represents an important challenge for psychiatric research. We investigated whether self-reported attentional control in emotionally demanding situations prospectively predicted changes in diurnal salivary cortisol secretion following exposure to a prolonged psychosocial stressor. Low ability to voluntarily control attention has previously been associated with anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Attentional control was assessed using the Emotional Attentional Control Scale. In students who were preparing for academic examination, salivary cortisol was assessed before (time 1) and after (time 2) examination. Results showed that lower levels of self-reported emotional attentional control at time 1 (N = 90) predicted higher absolute diurnal cortisol secretion and a slower decline in cortisol throughout the day at time 2 (N = 71). Difficulty controlling attention during emotional experiences may lead to chronic HPA-axis hyperactivity after prolonged exposure to stress. These results indicate that screening for individual differences may foster prediction of HPA-axis disturbances, paving the way for targeted disorder prevention.},

Recent Monte Carlo studies by Hay, Leu, and Rohrer (1987) and Manning, Duan, and Rogers (1987) find that the two-part model performs better than the sample selection model even when the latter is the true model. We show that Manning, Duan, and Rogers' negative results regarding the sample selection model are caused by a critical design problem. We demonstrate that their data generating process produces serious collinearity problems that bias against the sample selection model. Once the design problem is rectified, the poor performance of the sample selection model evaporates. Our Monte Carlo results offer a more balanced view on the relative merits of the two models as each model performs well under different conditions. In particular, the sample selection model is susceptible to collinearity problems and a t-test can be used to distinguish between the two models as long as there are no collinearity problems. As an example, we employ Mroz's (1987) labor supply data to illustrate how his tests for selectivity bias might have been affected by collinearity problems.},

  abstract = {Objective~         Because of fast-growing interest in the applications of mindfulness to promote well-being and mental health, there are field-wide efforts to better understand how mindfulness training works and thereby to optimize its delivery. Key to these efforts is the role of home practice in mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) outcomes. Despite its centrality in MBIs, recent reviews have documented limited and mixed effects of home practice on MBI outcomes. However, methodological issues regarding monitoring and quantifying home practice and focus on cumulative or additive effects may limit our understanding of it. Temporally proximate, more transient, and contextually circumscribed effects of mindfulness mediation practice have not been examined.         Methods~         We applied intensive experience sampling to measure daily practice and levels of targeted proximal outcomes (state mindfulness, decentering, emotional valance, and arousal) of training over the course of a 21-day MBI among a community-based sample of 82 meditation-naive adults.         Results~         Despite intensive experience sampling, we found no evidence of cumulative or additive effects of total mindfulness meditation practice on outcomes at postintervention for mindfulness, decentering, emotional valence, or emotional arousal. However, we found that that daily dose of mindfulness meditation home practice significantly predicted same-day levels of state mindfulness (B = 0.004, SE = 0.001, t = 3.17, p = .000, f2 = 0.24), decentering (B = 0.004, SE = 0.001, t = 2.757, p = .006, f2 = 0.05), and emotional valence (B = 0.006, SE = 0.003, t = 2.015, p = .044, f2 = 0.01) but not daily levels of emotional arousal. Daily dose-response practice effects did not carry over to next-day levels of monitored outcomes.         Conclusions~         Findings show that effects of daily home mindfulness meditation practice dose on state mindfulness, decentering, and positive emotion are reliable but transient and time-limited. Findings are discussed with respect to the proposed daily dose-response hypothesis of mindfulness meditation practice.},

Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, is becoming more prevalent owing to rising rates of obesity, physical inactivity and urbanisation. Type 1 diabetes exists in two major forms in the region: type 1A or autoimmune and type 1B or ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes. At present there are scanty epidemiological data on either. The current morbidity of diabetes is primarily due to the high rates of microvascular complications, while macrovascular complications, once rare, are becoming more common, particularly in the urban setting. Further, despite the HIV epidemic, the total number of people with diabetes in the region is expected to grow because of changing demography. A concerted multisectoral effort will be critical to ensuring improvement in healthcare delivery for people with diabetes in the region. Diabetes, an important component of the non-communicable diseases, is undoubtedly a rising problem globally. Sub-Saharan Africa is not immune to the process, and is experiencing a triple and in many instances, a quadruple burden of disease, as the traditional infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis have been joined by non-communicable diseases in addition to HIV. In certain countries high levels of trauma and violence contribute further to the burden of disease.1 All this occurs in a region in which over 40\% of the population live on},

We test potential mechanisms including beliefs, affiliation, and social networks, and we find that having a strong network of religious friends explains the effect of church attendance for several civic and neighborly outcomes. We suggest this phenomenon may exist in other, non-religious, spheres that also produce strong friendship networks.},

Three key results are noted. First, if data are missing completely at random, MI can be notably more e cient than the CC and GEE methods. Second, with small samples, GEE often fails due to `convergence problems', but MI is free of that problem. Finally, if the data are missing at random, while the CC and GEE methods yield results with moderate to large bias, MI generally yields results with negligible bias.

Past research suggests that women give and receive more emotional support than do men, but little research has explored gender differences in overall patterns of exchanging social support. We use latent class analysis of data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study to show that there are four major patterns of social support exchange for both men and women at midlife. Three of these patterns\textemdash high exchange, emotional support exchange, and low exchange\textemdash are very similar for men and women. However, almost half of men can be characterized as low exchangers while almost half of women can be characterized as emotional support exchangers. Around 10\% of both men and women are high exchangers. Multivariate analyses show that among both men and women, the unmarried are the most likely to be high exchangers after controlling for other factors that might possibly be related to the exchange of social support. \'O 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Using a new panel dataset, this study offers strong evidence for social and participatory mechanisms shaping religion's impact on life satisfaction. Our findings suggest that religious people are more satisfied with their lives because they regularly attend religious services and build social networks in their congregations. The effect of within-congregation friendship is contingent, however, on the presence of a strong religious identity. We find little evidence that other private or subjective aspects of religiosity affect life satisfaction independent of attendance and congregational friendship.},

Using the well-being module from the 2010\textendash 13 American Time Use Survey (ATUS), I show that churchgoers enjoy a significantly higher level of affective well-being on Sunday than non-churchgoers do. The supplementary analysis of the Gallup Daily Poll data suggests that this higher level of affective well-being among churchgoers is found throughout the rest of the week as well. Further analyses of the ATUS demonstrate that about 40 percent of the affective well-being gap between churchgoers and non-churchgoers on Sunday can be explained by how they spend their time differently. Churchgoers spend more time on Sunday participating in pleasant activities shared with family members and friends than non-churchgoers do. More than half of the gap, however, remains unexplained, implying that it has to do with how they feel during similar activities rather than the activities in which they participate. I discuss the implications of these findings on the mechanisms underlying the link between religion and subjective well-being.},

In The Black Church in the African American Experience, based on a ten-year study, is the largest nongovernmental study of urban and rural churches ever undertaken and the first major field study on the subject since the 1930s.Drawing on interviews with more than 1,800 black clergy in both urban and rural settings, combined with a comprehensive historical overview of seven mainline black denominations, C. Eric Lincoln and Lawrence H. Mamiya present an analysis of the Black Church as it relates to the history of African Americans and to contemporary black culture. In examining both the internal structure of the Church and the reactions of the Church to external, societal changes, the authors provide important insights into the Church's relationship to politics, economics, women, youth, and music.Among other topics, Lincoln and Mamiya discuss the attitude of the clergy toward women pastors, the reaction of the Church to the civil rights movement, the attempts of the Church to involve young people, the impact of the black consciousness movement and Black Liberation Theology and clergy, and trends that will define the Black Church well into the next century.This study is complete with a comprehensive bibliography of literature on the black experience in religion.

Additionally, this study sought to explore personal and professional barriers among clergy to living a healthier life.

Survey items included participants' demographic information and health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol). The self-reported general health, mental health, and physical health data were also collected to compare to the general population in Kansas. Clergy were also asked to identify perceived barriers to health. A total of 150 clergy participated in the survey. The majority (93.7 \%) self-reported their health as good, very good, or excellent. Participating clergy self-reported a higher prevalence of chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol) than the Kansas general population, but those differences were not statistically significant. More than three-fourths (77.4 \%) of the participating clergy reported weights and heights that classified them as either overweight or obese. Lack of family time was the most frequently reported personal barrier to achieving a healthier lifestyle. An unpredictable work schedule was reported as the most frequent professional barrier to achieving a healthier lifestyle. This study suggests that Kansas clergy generally view their overall health status favorably despite being overweight or obese. Clergy also self-reported higher prevalence of chronic diseases than the general Kansas population, though the prevalence was not statistically different. This study provides additional insight into clergy health and offers suggestions to address the barriers preventing clergy from working toward better health.},

Some evidence is found for support matching. Emotional support is more often received for social stressors than for nonsocial stressors. It is also more often received from relationships outside the workplace than from work relationships. Work relationships provide the most tangible assistance and information for stressors that have occurred at work, but nonwork relationships provide the most assistance and information for nonwork stressors. For work stressors, superiors provide the most information and emotional support, whereas subordinates provide the most tangible assistance. However, the gender of the support recipient and the controllability of the stressor are not associated with support receipt.},

We evaluated the prospective associations between service attendance and marital stability in mid and late life considering either 1) divorce or separation; or 2) remarriage, as separate outcomes. Data were drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, a large prospective cohort study that consisted of US female nurses in their 50s at study enrollment, with repeated measures of service attendance and marital status over 14 years of follow-up from 1996\textendash 2010. During follow up, among 66,444 initially married nurses who were mainly Christians, frequent service attendance was associated with 50\% lower risk of divorce (95\% CI: 32\%, 63\%), and 52\% lower risk of either divorce or separation (95\%CI: 37\%, 63\%). Among initially divorced or separated women, frequent service attendance was not associated with subsequent likelihood of remarriage; however, among widowed women, women who attended services frequently had 49\% increased likelihood of remarriage (95\% CI: 13\%, 97\%) compared to those women who did not. The study provides evidence that in this cohort of US nurses, frequent service attendance is associated with lower risk of becoming divorced in mid- and late- life, and increased likelihood of remarriage among widowed nurses, but not among divorced or separated nurses.},

We sought to assess whether a single underlying factor could represent the metabolic syndrome in adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \textemdash{} Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999 \textendash 2002), we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to assess the validity of waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) as potential phenotypic traits for the metabolic syndrome in adolescents aged 12\textendash 17 years (n ϭ 1,262). A multiple-group approach was used to test the invariance in factor loadings across sex and race/ethnicity. RESULTS \textemdash{} The estimates of factor loadings for the total sample were 0.76, 0.46, 0.81, and 0.42 for waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and SBP, respectively. The goodnessof-fit indexes were adequate for the total sample (comparative fit index, 0.99; standardized root mean square residual, 0.02), Caucasian boys (1.0; 0.01), African-American boys (0.99; 0.03), Mexican-American boys (1.0; 0.01), Mexican-American girls (1.0; 0.01), and Caucasian girls (0.95; 0.04) and acceptable for African-American girls (0.94; 0.05). There were no significant differences in factor loadings of the four measured variables between boys and girls and among the three racial or ethnic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} The metabolic syndrome as a single underlying factor for the four simple phenotypic traits may be plausible in adolescents. The proposed model appears to be generalizable across sex and race/ethnicity.},

The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is commonly used in addiction research but has been critiqued for not appropriately adjusting for between-person variance. Alternatives to the CLPM have been suggested but remain underutilized. The primary purpose of this article is to highlight interpretational limitations of the CLPM and to provide examples of alternative models. Method: We specified CLPM, Random-Intercept CLPM, and a Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals using four waves of data from Project MATCH (n = 1,201). We modeled prospective relations among depression symptoms and temptation to drink. Substantive inferences and assumptions across models were compared. Results: The CLPM provided the most evidence of significant cross-lagged paths but the poorest fit to the data compared to other models. Alternative models found little evidence of prospective within-person associations, and more evidence for between-person associations and wave-specific within-person relations between depression symptoms and temptation to drink. Conclusions: This study highlights shortcomings of the CLPM and details alternative models to consider. Addiction researchers should consider alternatives to the CLPM to more optimally delineate relations among constructs across time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Frameworks on employee mental health incorporate elements of both enjoyment/difficulties and values (i.e., hedonic and eudaimonic elements), yet existing studies focus on caregivers' mental illness and overlook their specific work activities. Methods We collected diary activity log, survey, and interview data from caregivers from five geographic locations: Hyderabad, India; Nagaland, India; Ethiopia; Kenya; and Cambodia. We coded and calculated the amount of time spent on five frequent activities: cleaning, cooking, caring for children, supervising children, and informal educational activities. We calculated the mean scores of perceived importance, meaningfulness, enjoyment, and unpleasantness for each of the five activities by geographic location. Results A total of 82 participants completed surveys and activity logs, and 69 of them participated in interviews. Mean time spent per day for the five activities combined ranged from 4.4~h (Nagaland) to 9.0~h (Ethiopia). Cooking and cleaning constituted a large portion of caregivers' days, ranging from 0.8~h per caregiver per day in Nagaland to 4.7~h in Cambodia, and informal educational activities (such as advising, teaching children their letters, and teaching from religious texts) constituted the least time, ranging from 0.1~h per caregiver per day in Hyderabad to 1.1~h in Nagaland. Participants rated all activities high in importance, with cleaning being relatively lower. Overall, enjoyment scores were lower than importance and meaningfulness scores. Informal educational activities had the highest enjoyment scores in three locations, whereas supervising children did in two locations. Participants rated cleaning as the most unpleasant activity in each geographic region except Cambodia, where it was rated on par with educational activities. Discussion OSC caregivers consider several regular activities to be very important and meaningful. Enjoyment may be improved through additional support in child behavior management or spending more time providing informal educational activities; at minimum, caregiver mental health should be considered before turning informal educational activities over to volunteers.},

However, prevention efforts targeting this population may be hindered because of the stigma associated with homosexuality in traditional Chinese culture. We conducted qualitative interviews with 30 MSM in Shanghai to better understand the types and sources of stigma and discrimination and how MSM respond to them. The stigma associated with homosexuality can be traced back to four culturally based factors: social status and relationships, the value of family, perceptions of immorality and abnormality, and gender stereotypes of masculinity. In particular, the centrality of the family and the importance of maintaining key relationships caused stress and anxiety, contributing to more frequent encounters with felt stigma. In response, MSM often evaded the scrutiny of family members through various tactics, even prompting some to leave their rural homes. Implications of these findings on HIV/AIDS prevention are discussed.},

We then consider differences across birth cohorts in the genetic influence on BMI, and cohort variations in the moderating effects of life-course SES on the genetic influence. Our analyses suggest that persistently low SES over the life course or downward mobility (e.g., high SES in childhood but low SES in adulthood) amplify the genetic influence on BMI, and persistently high SES or upward mobility (e.g., low SES in childhood but high SES in adulthood) compensate for such influence. For more recent birth cohorts, the genetic influence on BMI becomes stronger, but the moderating effects of lifetime SES on the genetic influence are weaker compared to earlier cohorts.

Study Design: Review of behavioral and STD/HIV prevention studies addressing MSM in China. Results: Sexual risk behaviors including unprotected group sex, anal sex, casual sex, and commercial sex were prevalent among Chinese MSM. Many Chinese MSM also engaged in unprotected sex with both men and women. Most MSM either did not perceive that they were at risk of HIV/AIDS or underestimated their risk of infection. Surveillance and intervention research among these men are still in the preliminary stages. Conclusions: Chinese MSM are at risk for HIV/STD infection and potential transmission of HIV to the general population. In addition to sexual risk reduction among MSM, reduction of homosexualityrelated stigma should be part of effective intervention efforts. Volunteers from the MSM community and health care workers in primary health care system may serve as valuable resources for HIV/STD prevention and control among MSM.},

Objectives The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors of arterial hypertension in the Kinshasa region, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Design and methods Data were collected from random sample cross-sectional surveys of adult black Africans from Kinshasa, with the help of a structured questionnaire, physical examinations and blood samples, using the World Health Organisation (WHO) stepwise approach. Sex, age, place of residence (urban versus rural), psychosocial risk factors (socioeconomic status, stress), overweight status (BMI: 25\textendash 29.9 kg/m2), general obesity (BMI: {$\geq$} 30 kg/m2), abdominal obesity (waist circumference: {$\geq$} 94 cm) and diabetes mellitus were considered to be the potential risk factors for screen-detected hypertension. Results The weighted prevalences of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight status, general obesity and abdominal obesity were 15.2, 140.2, 13.5, 4.8 and 7.5\%, respectively. Blood pressure and the proportion of participants with hypertension increased with age and BMI group in the population, for both men and women. Age, rural residence, low socioeconomic status, high socioeconomic status, general obesity and abdominal obesity were the risk factors for hypertension. Women aged 55 years and above had higher levels of blood pressure and hypertension than men. Conclusion Absolute levels of hypertension, all types of obesity and diabetes mellitus are high risk factors in the army camps and semiurban extension cities; general obesity and abdominal obesity are the risk factors for detectable hypertension. Effective control of general obesity and abdominal obesity and psychosocial strategies that target both semirural and urban areas of the Kinshasa region have the potential to prevent much premature cardiovascular disease.},

Methods We assessed construct validity in a cross-sectional sample of 1619 medical outpatients (mean age 43{$\pm$}14 years, 64\% female) by comparing the PHQ-2 to four longer self-report questionnaires. Criterion validity was established in a subsample of 520 participants with reference to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Sensitivity to change was investigated in a prospective study of 167 patients who completed the SCID both at baseline and the 1-year follow-up. Results With reference to the SCID, the PHQ-2 had a sensitivity of 87\% and a specificity of 78\% for major depressive disorder and a sensitivity of 79\% and a specificity of 86\% for any depressive disorder. Its diagnostic performance was comparable with that of longer depression scales. PHQ-2 change scores accurately reflected improved, unchanged, and deteriorated depression outcomes. Conclusion The PHQ-2 performed favorably with respect to a standard diagnostic interview, as well as established depression scales and proved sensitive to change. Thus, the PHQ-2 appears promising as a brief multipurpose measure for detecting depression, grading its severity, and monitoring outcomes over time.},

Patients on outpatient medication for hypertension at Vanga Hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) often present with uncontrolled hypertension and some with hypertension emergencies. On enquiry, the problem appeared to revolve around compliance. Method : The study was a qualitative, descriptive study using the focus group interview technique for data collection. Subjects were purposely selected. Interviews were conducted from 23 March to 19 July 2006. Three focus groups were formed: The first was heterogeneous in terms of gender (five males and three females), the second homogeneous (six males) and the last also homogeneous (six females). The group members varied with respect to characteristics such as place of residence, occupation and educational standard. The data collected were analysed using the thematic analysis method within grounded theory. Results : Five themes emerged as possible explanations for non-compliance: Side effects discouraged patients from taking medication; patients took medication only when they experienced perceived symptoms of hypertension; poor knowledge of the disease and the medication used; lack of support by family members; and difficulty in obtaining antihypertensive medication. Conclusion : Side effects of the medication, lack of information and support, difficulty in obtaining the medication and the fact that the disease is mainly silent played a major role in the poor adherence to hypertension medication. Sustained health promotion and education should be undertaken at all levels of patient contact to ensure good compliance.},

Data were obtained from 25 Argentineans in Spain, who were interviewed twice in a 2-year interval. Qualitative interviews were used to estimate the amount of measurement error and to isolate important predictors. Quantitative analyses showed that the persistence of ties was explained by tie strength, network density, and alters' country of origin and residence. Furthermore, transitivity appeared to be an important tendency, both for acquiring new contacts and for the relationships among alters. At the network level, immigrants' networks were remarkably stable in composition and structure despite the high turnover. Clustered graphs have been used to illustrate the results. The results are discussed in light of adaptation to the host society.},

Contributors to the obesity epidemic are complex and numerous, and may include several work characteristics. Purpose: To explore associations between occupational factors and obesity among U.S. workers. Methods: Data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey were utilized to calculate weighted prevalence rates and prevalence ratios (PRs) for obesity in relation to workweek length, work schedule, work arrangement, hostile work environment, job insecurity, work\textendash family imbalance, and industry and occupation of employment. Data were collected in 2010 and analyzed in 2012\`A2013. Results: Overall, 27.7\% of U.S. workers met the BMI criterion for obesity. Among all workers, employment for more than 40 hours per week and exposure to a hostile work environment were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of obesity, although the differences were modest. Employment in health care and social assistance and public administration industries, as well as architecture and engineering, community and social service, protective service, and office and administrative support occupations was also associated with increased obesity prevalence. Conclusions: Work-related factors may contribute to the high prevalence of obesity in the U.S. working population. Public health professionals and employers should consider workplace interventions that target organization-level factors, such as scheduling and prevention of workplace hostility, along with individual-level factors such as diet and exercise.},

This study aimed to assess the management of hypertension in primary health care settings by using guidelines of the International Forum for Prevention and Control of HTN in Africa (IFHA). Methods A multi-center cross-sectional study was carried out in primary health care settings. A total of 102 nurses were surveyed using a structured interview. Mean and proportion comparisons were performed using the t Student test and the Chi-square test respectively. The Kinshasa Primary Health Care network facilities were compared with non-Kinshasa Primary Health Care network facilities. Results From the 102 nurses surveyed; 52.9 \% were female with a mean age of 41.1, (SD\,=\,10) years, merely 9.5 \% benefited from in-job training on cardiovascular diseases or their risk factors, and 51.7 \% had guidelines on the management of hypertension. Less than a quarter of the nurses knew the cut-off values of hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Merely 14.7 \% knew the therapeutic goals for uncomplicated hypertension. Several of the indicators for immediate referral recommended by IFHA were unmentioned. The content of patient education was lacking, avoiding stress being the best advice provided to hypertensive patients. The antihypertensive most used were unlikely to be recommended by the IFHA. Conclusions This study showed a considerable gap of knowledge and practices in the management of hypertensive patients at primary health care facilities in Kinshasa pertaining to the IFHA guidelines. We think that task-shifting for management of hypertension is feasible if appropriate guidelines are provided and nurses trained.},

However, recent studies have shown that traditional RDS methods are likely to generate large variances and may be severely biased since the assumptions behind RDS are seldom fully met in real life. To improve estimation in RDS studies, we propose a new method to generate estimates with ego network data, which is collected by asking RDS respondents about the composition of their personal networks, such as ``what proportion of your friends are married?''. By simulations on an extracted real-world social network of gay men as well as on artificial networks with varying structural properties, we show that the new estimator, RDS Iego shows superior performance over traditional RDS estimators. Importantly, RDS Iego exhibits strong robustness to the preference of peer recruitment and variations in network structural properties, such as homophily, activity ratio, and community structure. While the biases of traditional RDS estimators can sometimes be as large as 10\% {$\sim$} 20\%, biases of all RDS Iego estimates are well restrained to be less than 2\%. The positive results henceforth encourage researchers to collect ego network data for variables of interests by RDS, for both hard-to-access populations and general populations when random sampling is not applicable. The limitation of RDS Iego is evaluated by simulating RDS assuming different level of reporting error.},

We argue that this technical difficulty reflects a disconnection between how cohort effect is conceptualized and how it is modeled in the traditional age-period-cohort framework. We propose a new method, called the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model, that is qualitatively different from previous methods in that it represents Ryder's (1965) theoretical account about the conditions under which cohort differentiation may arise. This APC-I model does not require problematic statistical assumptions and the interpretation is straightforward. It quantifies inter-cohort deviations from the age and period main effects and also permits hypothesis testing about intra-cohort life-course dynamics. We demonstrate how this new model can be used to examine age, period, and cohort patterns in women's labor force participation.},

The RE approach has recently been applied to age-period-cohort (APC) models that are unidentified because the predictors are exactly linearly dependent. However, research has not fully explained how the RE specification identifies these otherwise unidentified APC models. We address this challenge by first making explicit that RE-APC models have greater\textemdash not less\textemdash rank deficiency than the traditional fixed-effects model, followed by two empirical examples. We then provide intuition and a mathematical proof to explain that for APC models with one RE, treating one effect as an RE is equivalent to constraining the estimates of that effect's linear component and the random intercept to be zero. For APC models with two REs, the effective constraints implied by the model depend on the true (i.e., in the data-generating mechanism) nonlinear components of the effects that are modeled as REs, so that the estimated linear components of the REs are determined by the true nonlinear components of those effects. In conclusion, RE-APC models impose arbitrary although highly obscure constraints and thus do not differ qualitatively from other constrained APC estimators.},

There is also an emerging understanding of how psychological and behavioral factors used in interventions can impact these physiological processes. This review outlines our current understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which psychological, social, and behavioral processes can affect cancer progression. The intervention literature is discussed, along with recommendations for future research to move the field of biobehavioral oncology forward.},

Using data from the fifth wave of the Clergy Health Initiative panel survey, we used cross-group models to examine the association of depressive symptoms and network in-degree, out-degree, and perceived social isolation among men (N = 1,145) and women (N = 535) clergy. The analysis reveals gendered differences in this association. Specifically, out-degree bore a significant negative relationship with depressive symptoms for men but not women. Feeling socially isolated had a significant positive association with depression in both men and women.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \textemdash{} One hundred and nine adolescents participated in a four-wave longitudinal study spanning four years (mean age at Time 1 was 13.77). Patients were visited at home and completed questionnaires measuring coping and psychological symptoms. The treating physicians were contacted to obtain A1C values. Cross-lagged path analysis from a structural equation modeling approach was used for data analysis. RESULTS \textemdash{} Clinically meaningful pathways between coping and glycemic control were found across time. Active coping prospectively predicted lower A1C levels, which, in turn, predicted active coping. Higher A1C levels and higher psychological symptoms consistently predicted avoidance coping across time. Finally, psychological symptomatology constituted an important link in the observed longitudinal chain of effects. More specifically, higher A1C values and symptomatology at Time 1 positively predicted withdrawal at Time 2, which, in turn, positively predicted symptomatology at Time 3. Next, symptomatology at Time 3 positively predicted higher A1C values at Time 4, thus coming full circle. CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} Coping with everyday stress, psychological symptoms, and glycemic control were interrelated across time. Evidence was obtained for reciprocal pathways and mutually reinforcing mechanisms, indicating the need to monitor coping strategies and psychological symptoms along with glycemic control in optimizing clinical care in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.},

Cross-sectional data were collected from 160 adult caregivers (parents, relatives, or other adults) from a rural area in China where many residents were infected with HIV through unhygienic blood collection. The sample included 120 caregivers from households caring for AIDS orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and 40 from households without OVC. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to assess the symptoms of depression among the caregivers. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the associations of depressive symptoms with various individual and family factors among caregivers. The mean score of CES-D for the entire sample was 19.18 (17.84 for men and 20.44 for women). The univariate analysis indicated that the score of CES-D was significantly higher among caregivers with lower education, fewer household items/assets, from families with adult or pediatric HIV infection. Controlling for age, gender, and caregivers' education, multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations between symptoms of depression and reduced family socioeconomic status (SES), adult or pediatric HIV infection in family. Our results indicated an elevated level of depression symptoms among caregivers of OVC and underscored the needs for psychological support and intervention for their caregivers, especially for those with lower family SES, from families with an adult or pediatric HIV infection.},

This article reflects on this issue, in the context of an analysis of the relationship between sexual and gender-based violence and hegemonic masculinities in the conflict zone of North Kivu province in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. It draws on a research study focusing on the discrepancies between dominant ideals of masculinity and the actual realities of men's lives. As men try to enact masculine ideals of breadwinner and family head, the current political and economic context puts them under increasing pressure. Respondents drew a direct connection between the resulting sense of failure and unhealthy outlets for asserting masculinity, lack of productivity, and violence. They were critical of the fact that most programmes dealing with sexual and gender-based violence focus exclusively on supporting women. I argue here that such interventions do not recognise the interdependent and interactive nature of gender. Their antagonising effect is evidenced by the high level of men's resistance to programmes and campaigns promoting gender equality. The article further highlights the role of `hegemonic masculinity' in creating a general climate of violence and conflict, pointing up the need for holistic approaches that empower men to make non-violent life choices.},

We briefly review recent historical trends in the study of the effects of place on health in industrial countries, and argue that ``place effects'' often appear to have the status of a residual category, an unspecified black box of somewhat mystical influences on health which remain after investigators have controlled for a range of individual and place characteristics. We note that the distinction between ``composition'' and ``context'' may be more apparent than real, and that features of both material infrastructure and collective social functioning may influence health. We suggest using a framework of universal human needs as a basis for thinking about how places may influence health, and recommend the testing of hypotheses about specific chains of causation that might link place of residence with health outcomes. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results Compared to workers with no psychological injury, workers with a high PIRI score had a significantly increased risk of having at least one metabolic syndrome component (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.8; 95\% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.6). There was a significant increase in the risk of hypertriglyceridemia in male workers (OR 2.53 CI95\% 1.03-6.22), and of hypertension in female workers (OR 2.45 CI95\% 1.29-4.66).

In fact, support that is ``invisible'' (not perceived by the support recipient) is associated with better outcomes than ``visible'' support. To investigate this paradox, we proposed that received support (both visible and invisible) would be beneficial when it was responsive to the recipient's needs. Sixty-seven cohabiting couples participated in a daily-experience study in which they reported on the support they provided and received each day. Results indicated that both visible and invisible support were beneficial (i.e., associated with less sadness and anxiety and with greater relationship quality) only when the support was responsive. These findings suggest that the nature of support is an important determinant of when received support will be beneficial.},

At each measurement time, the participants filled in the same scales of burnout, job demands and job resources. Using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), three developmental profiles of burnout symptoms were identified: 1) Stable, low burnout (78\%), 2) Exhaustion instigated, increasing burnout (12\%), and 3) Cynicism and reduced professional efficacy dominated, inverted U-shaped burnout (10\%). Exhaustion instigated, increasing burnout profile displayed the highest levels of job demands, whereas Cynicism and reduced professional efficacy dominated, inverted U-shaped burnout profile reported the lowest levels of job resources compared to members in other profiles. Recognizing the existence of the multiple sequential development of burnout symptoms and different patterns of job demands and the job resources behind them, this study suggests that burnout development does not follow a uniform shape, which reconciles previously inconsistent findings of variable-centred burnout research.},

  abstract = {Christian ministry work can be gratifying, but it also carries a risk of burnout. Despite research documenting clergy stress and wellness, few questionnaires measure ministry life aspects that contribute to clergy burnout or wellness. To fill this gap, we developed the positive aspects (PAI) and negative aspects (NAI) inventories. These questionnaires measure the intensity and frequency of positive and negative aspects of ministry life. The present research further tests the viability of the PAI and NAI. Confirmatory factor analyses suggest that the PAI is best represented by 17 factors, whereas 12 factors best characterize the NAI. Importantly, correlation patterns between PAI and NAI scores and indices of burnout suggest distinct patterns of burnout. Furthermore, exploratory tests of PAI and NAI scores by gender, ordination status, and years in ministry demonstrated crucial differences. This research advances the understanding of clergy wellness and has implications for assessment and intervention.},

  abstract = {Background Self-administered questionnaires, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), are regularly used in clinical practice to guide prescribing or to measure recovery and response to treatment. There are concerns that patients are not all interpreting the questionnaire items in the same way. Cognitive interviewing is a research technique that identifies `interpretative measurement error' (IME). IME is distinct from traditional components of measurement error, such as not reading the question as worded, or recording answers inaccurately. Aim To use cognitive interviewing techniques to explore patterns in answer mapping and comprehension of the PHQ-9 questionnaire to ascertain whether the measure captures meaningful symptoms of low mood. Design and setting Qualitative study using cognitive interviewing techniques and card sorting in six GP practices in Bristol. Method The study recruited 18 participants at the point of entry to a longitudinal primary care depression cohort study, PANDA (the indications for Prescribing ANtiDepressants that will leAd to a clinical benefit). Participants were interviewed 2, 4, and 6 weeks after their baseline visit. Cognitive interviews were digitally recorded. Analysis used the digital audio file, rather than verbatim transcripts, as it retained important features needed for analyses. Results Cognitive interviewing revealed that items on the PHQ-9 are interpreted in a range of ways, that patients often cannot `fit' their experience into the response options, and therefore often feel the questionnaire is misrepresenting their experience of meaningful symptoms of low mood. Conclusion The PHQ-9 may be missing the presence and/or intensity of certain symptoms that are meaningful to patients. Clinicians should adopt caution when using it.},

In an exercise which simulates the organization as a resource dilemma, power balance (equal, unequal) is manipulated in five-person groups to examine its impact on coalition formation and group outcomes. In a 15 round game players had the option of forming coalitions, which decreased the size of the resource pool, or practicing collective resource allocation, which increased it. Unequal power balanced groups were more likely to begin the exercise by forming coalitions and distributing the resource pool to a subset of group members than equal power balanced groups. Unequal power balanced groups also included fewer people in the funding distributions across all 15 rounds than did groups with equal power. As a result, unequal power balanced groups had significantly lower individual as well as group outcomes than did equal power balanced groups. Unequal power balanced groups also used the resource pool less efficiently than equal power balanced groups, and only equal power balanced groups were able to significantly increase the size of the resource pool across all game rounds. Finally, unequal power balanced groups had more difficulty reaching funding allocation agreements than equal power balanced groups. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for small group decision making in organizations.},

As global consumption of sugar-sweetened products has sharply increased in recent years, examining the validity of claims of an association between CHOs and mood is of high importance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between acute CHO ingestion and mood. We examined the time-course of CHO\textendash mood interactions and considered the role of moderator variables potentially affecting the CHO\textendash mood relationship. Analysis of 176 effect sizes (31 studies, 1259 participants) revealed no positive effect of CHOs on any aspect of mood at any time-point following their consumption. However, CHO administration was associated with higher levels of fatigue and less alertness compared with placebo within the first hour post-ingestion. These findings challenge the idea that CHOs can improve mood, and might be used to increase the public's awareness that the `sugar rush' is a myth, inform health policies to decrease sugar consumption, and promote healthier alternatives.},

Sharp decreases in the late 1960s and early 1970s were followed by more modest losses for the next 25~years, with sharper declines returning at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Analysis of denominational data on the components of change reveals two major factors linked to the most recent drop: departures of schismatic congregations in five denominations that have liberalized gay- and lesbian-related policies, and fewer individuals joining mainline denominations. Furthermore, child baptism rates are dropping and, in at least one denomination, the ratio of child professions of faith to child baptisms a decade earlier has fallen faster than membership over the past 13~years. These findings are largely consistent with previous research using national survey data that shows low fertility in the mainline, a drop in transfers into the mainline from more conservative churches, and general increases in the percent of the U.S. population with no religious affiliation. Together, the evidence strongly suggests continued mainline membership losses for the indeterminate future.},

Individual, relational, and network characteristics that influence network instability in the absence of a significant life transition/crisis are less understood.

This study is based on longitudinal survey data of middle-class adults who did not undergo life changes. Even in this context of relative stability, support networks experience rates of dormancy similar to those observed during periods of major upheaval. Tie dormancy is unrelated to individual characteristics, network size and density, or homophily along dimensions other than sex. Frequency and medium of communication are particularly notable as factors that were not related to tie dormancy. Ties were less likely to become dormant if they were geographically or emotionally close, immediate kin or neighbors, highly supportive, the same sex, or more embedded in the network. These findings provide context for how support networks operate when not buffeted by exogenous forces. They provide a baseline for understanding the impact on networks of transitions, trauma, new media, and difficult life circumstances.},

Then, the literature on emotion regulation is reviewed, highlighting its importance as a mechanism in the psychopathology of depression. Finally, potential interpersonal influences on depressive emotion regulation and dysregulation are suggested, drawing from theory and research on psychotherapy and on close relationships. The review suggests that emotion regulation is responsive to interpersonal influences, and that this responsiveness may account for the effects of social support on depression. Implications of an interpersonal perspective for basic and clinical research on depression, close relationships, and emotion regulation are discussed.},

  abstract = {Name generators used to measure egocentric networks are complex survey questions that make substantial demands on respondents and interviewers alike. They are therefore vulnerable to interviewer effects, which arise when interviewers administer questions differently in ways that affect responses-in this case, the number of names elicited. Van Tilburg [Sociol. Methods Res. 26 (1998) 300] found significant interviewer effects on network size in a study of elderly Dutch respondents; that study included an instrument with seven name generators, the complexity of which may have accentuated interviewer effects. This article examines a simpler single-generator elicitation instrument administered in the 1998 General Social Survey (GSS). Interviewer effects on network size as measured by this instrument are smaller than those found by Van Tilburg, but only modestly so. Variations in the network size of respondents within interviewer caseloads (estimated using a single-item ``global'' measure of network size and an independent sample of respondents) reduce but do not explain interviewer effects on the name generator measure. Interviewer differences remain significant after further controls for between-interviewer differences in the sociodemographic composition of respondent pools. Further insight into the sources of interviewer effects may be obtained via monitoring respondent\textendash interviewer interactions for differences in how name generators are administered. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Among the book's many important findings are the greater willingness of ordinary Americans to accord rights of free expression to unpopular groups, to endorse formal racial equality, and to accept nontraditional roles for women in the workplace, politics, and the family. Some, but not all, signs indicate that political conservatism has grown, while a few suggest that Republicans and Democrats are more polarized. Some forms of social connectedness such as neighboring have declined, as has confidence in government, while participation in organized religion has softened. Despite rising standards of living, American happiness levels have changed little, though financial and employment insecurity has risen over three decades. Social Trends in American Life provides an invaluable perspective on how Americans view their lives and their society, and on how these views have changed over the last two generations.},

Two versions of the Severity of Violence Against Men Scale (SVAMS) were devised as a counterpart to the Severity of Violence Against Women Scales (SVAWS). On 10-point rating scales, college males (N = 570) rated how serious, aggressive, abusive, violent, and threatening it would be if a woman did each of 46 acts to a man. The mean of each act across the ratings was calculated and then submitted to factor analysis. Eight factors emerged representing threats of mild, moderate, and serous violence, actual mild, minor, moderate, and serious violence and sexual violence. Community men (N = 115) rated the same acts on seriousness, aggressiveness, and abusiveness. All factors were unidimensional. Second order factor analysis confirmed that two dimensions (physical threats and actual violence) were represented. In contrast to the SVAWS, sexual violence loaded with threats of physical violence. The groups' ratings of physical and emotional harm provided the weightings for future research with student (SVAMS-S) and adult (SVAMS) samples.},

Blau's version of this theory, like most others, is based on cross-sectional data. Using new panel data collected from 48 heterogeneous Japanese manufacturing firms in 1976 and 1983, this paper shows that prior size and complexity explain little of the variance in 1983 administrative intensity. We also find that in Japanese factories, as in U.S. school districts studied over time by previous researchers, changes in A/P ratios in declining size organizations are not simply the mirror image of what happens to personnel components in growing organizations. We conclude with a discussion of power versus efficiency explanations of this 'ratchet effect' and with a strong appeal that causal inferences in organization research be based more on longitudinal and panel data.},

This innovation brings exciting possibilities to theological work for grasping local social situations and structures, although it also brings significant new challenges. As a sociologist who uses ethnographic methods and pays attention to theological orientations and their effects, I view the work of ethnography as a powerful methodology filled with both possibilities and perils. The newfound enthusiasm for ethnography among theologians may not yet adequately recognize the hazards involved in the use of qualitative research methods for generating valid empirical observations. Insights generated by participant observation are constantly at risk of imposition of personal presumptions and asserted ``truths,'' especially when researchers enter the field with strongly held convictions and compelling worldviews. In this paper, a distinction between ``found theologies'' and ``imposed theologies'' is offered as a heuristic for conversation in the hope of further substantiating a sound basis for future scholarship.},

  abstract = {Background: To analyze the socioeconomics of the morbidly obese patient population and the impact on access to bariatric surgery using 2 nationally representative databases. Bariatric surgery is a life-changing and potentially life-saving intervention for morbid obesity. Access to bariatric surgical care among eligible patients might be adversely affected by a variety of socioeconomic factors. Methods: The national bariatric eligible population was identified from the 2005\textendash 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and compared with the adult noneligible population. The eligible cohort was then compared with patients who had undergone bariatric surgery in the 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and key socioeconomic disparities were identified and analyzed. Results: A total of 22,151,116 people were identified as eligible for bariatric surgery using the National Institutes of Health criteria. Compared with the noneligible group, the bariatric eligible group had significantly lower family incomes, lower education levels, less access to healthcare, and a greater proportion of nonwhite race (all P Ͻ.001). Bariatric eligibility was associated with significant adverse economic and health-related markers, including days of work lost (5 versus 8 days, P Ͻ.001). More than one third (35\%) of bariatric eligible patients were either uninsured or underinsured, and 15\% had incomes less than the poverty level. A total of 87,749 in-patient bariatric surgical procedures were performed in 2006. Most were performed in white patients (75\%) with greater median incomes (80\%) and private insurance (82\%). Significant disparities associated with a decreased likelihood of undergoing bariatric surgery were noted by race, income, insurance type, and gender. Conclusion: Socioeconomic factors play a major role in determining who does and does not undergo bariatric surgery, despite medical eligibility. Significant disparities according to race, income, education level, and insurance type continue to exist and should prompt focused public health efforts aimed at equalizing and expanding access.

Ethnic reinforcement attracts highly race-conscious participants who eventually move toward processes of ethnic transcendence and congregational integration. The value for researchers is that distinguishing ethnically transcendent and ethnically reinforcing processes encourages the discovery of subtle, racially specific, and continually reinforced affinities that would otherwise remain hidden in seemingly ethnically transcendent settings.},

  abstract = {Many scholars and church leaders believe that music and worship style are essential in stimulating diversity in congregations. Gerardo Marti draws on interviews with more than 170 congregational leaders and parishioners, as well as his experiences participating in worship services in a wide variety of Protestant, multiracial Southern Californian churches, to present this insightful study of the role of music in creating congregational diversity.  Worship across the Racial Divide offers a surprising conclusion: that there is no single style of worship or music that determines the likelihood of achieving a multiracial church. Far more important are the complex of practices of the worshipping community in the production and absorption of music. Multiracial churches successfully diversify by stimulating unobtrusive means of interracial and interethnic relations; in fact, preparation for music apart from worship gatherings proves to be just as important as its performance during services. Marti shows that aside from and even in spite of the varying beliefs of attendees and church leaders, diversity happens because music and worship create practical spaces where cross-racial bonds are formed.  This groundbreaking book sheds light on how race affects worship in multiracial churches. It will allow a new understanding of the dynamics of such churches, and provide crucial aid to church leaders for avoiding the pitfalls that inadvertently widen the racial divide.},

Research on the burnout experience for psychiatrists mirrors much of the broader literature, in terms of both sources and outcomes of burnout. But it has also identified some of the unique stressors that mental health professionals face when they are dealing with especially difficult or violent clients. Current issues of particular relevance for psychiatry include the links between burnout and mental illness, the attempts to redefine burnout as simply exhaustion, and the relative dearth of evaluative research on potential interventions to treat and/or prevent burnout. Given that the treatment goal for burnout is usually to enable people to return to their job, and to be successful in their work, psychiatry could make an important contribution by identifying the treatment strategies that would be most effective in achieving that goal.},

For the first time in more than twenty years, research has shown that members of both parties hold strongly unfavorable views of their opponents. This is polarization rooted in social identity, and it is growing. The campaign and election of Donald Trump laid bare this fact of the American electorate, its successful rhetoric of ``us versus them'' tapping into a powerful current of anger and resentment.  With Uncivil Agreement, Lilliana Mason looks at the growing social gulf across racial, religious, and cultural lines, which have recently come to divide neatly between the two major political parties. She argues that group identifications have changed the way we think and feel about ourselves and our opponents. Even when Democrats and Republicans can agree on policy outcomes, they tend to view one other with distrust and to work for party victory over all else. Although the polarizing effects of social divisions have simplified our electoral choices and increased political engagement, they have not been a force that is, on balance, helpful for American democracy. Bringing together theory from political science and social psychology, Uncivil Agreement clearly describes this increasingly ``social'' type of polarization in American politics and will add much to our understanding of contemporary politics.},

American Apartheid shows how the black ghetto was created by whites during the first half of the twentieth century in order to isolate growing urban black populations. It goes on to show that, despite the Fair Housing Act of 1968, segregation is perpetuated today through an interlocking set of individual actions, institutional practices, and governmental policies. In some urban areas the degree of black segregation is so intense and occurs in so many dimensions simultaneously that it amounts to "hypersegregation." The authors demonstrate that this systematic segregation of African Americans leads inexorably to the creation of underclass communities during periods of economic downturn. Under conditions of extreme segregation, any increase in the overall rate of black poverty yields a marked increase in the geographic concentration of indigence and the deterioration of social and economic conditions in black communities. As ghetto residents adapt to this increasingly harsh environment under a climate of racial isolation, they evolve attitudes, behaviors, and practices that further marginalize their neighborhoods and undermine their chances of success in mainstream American society. This book is a sober challenge to those who argue that race is of declining significance in the United States today.},

We examine all-cause mortality risk and mortality risk from heart disease, lung cancer, and unpreventable cancers. Findings reveal that temporal reductions in black and white men's and women's mortality rates were driven entirely by cohort changes in mortality. Findings also demonstrate that disparate cohort effects between education groups widened the education gap in all-cause mortality risk and mortality risk from heart disease and lung cancer across this time period. Educational disparities in mortality risk from unpreventable cancers, however, did not change. This research uncovers widening educational differences in adult mortality and demonstrates that a cohort perspective provides valuable insights for understanding recent temporal changes in U.S. mortality risk.},

This scale has been used in numerous studies. This study sought to develop a valid and reliable shorter form of the scale, called OAS2, in an adult sample of 690 participants, using experts' item ratings and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The OAS2 consisted of 8 items, which replicated the unidimensional structure of the OAS (Matos et al., 2011) and revealed a good fit. The OAS2 had good internal consistency (.82), similar to the longer version. The OAS2 has good concurrent and divergent validity, being highly correlated with the OAS (r=.91). The OAS and OAS2 have very similar significant correlations with measures of internal shame, psychopathology and anger, with no significant difference between them. Our results, suggest that the OAS2 is an economic, valid and reliable measure of external shame.},

  abstract = {A longstanding hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit large increases in blood pressure during psychological stress are at risk for atherosclerosis. We tested whether blood pressure changes during psychological stress predict subsequent coronary calcification (CaC) in young healthy adults. We evaluated 2816 healthy black and white women, 20 to 35 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, who were not using medication for hypertension or diabetes in 1987-1988. Participants completed video game and star tracing tasks while their blood pressure was recorded. Thirteen years later (2000-2001), they completed computed tomography measures of CaC. Overall 9.3\% (261 of 2816) had CaC present at follow-up. Each 10 mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure during the video game was associated with a 24\% increased odds of having CaC at follow-up (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; P=0.008). This association persisted after adjustment for age, race, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of myocardial infarction, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, body mass index, and resting or baseline blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.08 to 1.58; P=0.006). Blood pressure changes during the star tracing task were not associated with subsequent CaC. Blood pressure changes during a video game predicted the presence of CaC 13 years later. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports blood pressure reactivity to a stressor being related to calcification in the coronary arteries. Blood pressure reactivity may provide useful prognostic information about future risk beyond standard risk factors.},

This study examines gender differences in the dimensionality of social support. A large sample (N=3210) from the general population of women (60\%) and men aged between 18 and 65 years old (Mean age=34.1) responded to a brief scale with items assessing the distinct functions of the perceived availability of social support. Confirmatory factor analyses yielded one factor in the women's sample that measures global social support perceived, and two in the men's. The first factor in the men's sample measures emotional support (providing empathy, caring, validation of self-worth), and the second measures instrumental support (e.g. practical assistance or financial aid). We concluded that there are gender differences in the structure of perceived social support and that these differences can be explained by socialization experiences and social roles associated with gender.},

Here we examine how resting CVT, CVT reactivity to a postural challenge, and their interaction influence craving during imposed alcohol abstinence and their usual drinking among moderate to heavy drinkers. Methods Participants were recruited from the local community (final n = 29) and assessed for CVT functioning via respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at rest (RSA-rest) and during a postural challenge (RSA-react). Craving intensity was assessed throughout the day during 3-day periods of imposed alcohol abstinence (abstained days) and drinking as usual (normal days) via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Multilevel statistical modeling assessed relationships between patterns of CVT and diurnal craving. The primary hypothesis of interest was that the interaction of RSA-rest with RSA-react would be significantly associated with increased craving across the day. Results Overall, craving increased throughout the day and significantly decreased after drinking (p {$<$} 0.001). There was a significant interaction between RSA-rest and RSA-react with plots revealing that this effect was driven by an aberrant craving pattern among participants with higher RSA-rest and a sluggish vagal brake in response to a postural shift\textemdash atypical RSA-react. Conclusion Although additional research is needed to corroborate these findings, our results suggest that moderate-heavy drinkers characterized by higher RSA-rest and atypical RSA-react exhibit aberrant patterns of craving across the day that may represent a risk factor for AUD.},

We examined the possible role of perceived discrimination in generating that risk. Methods. The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, a nationally representative sample of adults aged 25 to 74 years, surveyed individuals self-identifying as homosexual or bisexual (n = 73) or heterosexual (n = 2844) about their lifetime and day-to-day experiences with discrimination. Also assessed were 1-year prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and substance dependence disorders; current psychologic distress; and self-rated mental health. Results. Homosexual and bisexual individuals more frequently than heterosexual persons reported both lifetime and day-to-day experiences with discrimination.Approximately 42\% attributed this to their sexual orientation, in whole or part. Perceived discrimination was positively associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators of psychiatric morbidity in the total sample. Controlling for differences in discrimination experiences attenuated observed associations between psychiatric morbidity and sexual orientation. Conclusions. Higher levels of discrimination may underlie recent observations of greater psychiatric morbidity risk among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.

As I write, it is the Occupy Wall Street movement, which is not only demanding greater economic and social equality for the bottom ninety-nine against the top one "percenters" but coining a new set of class categories in the process. Almost a decade ago, when I began research on American beliefs about rising inequality, it was the scandals surrounding Enron that were making front page news, with the pension funds of workers and retirees evaporating into thin air as the coffers of executives mysteriously survived. In between Enron and Occupy Wall Street, there is no shortage of occasions to reflect on the state of income inequality in the U.S. -the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, the outsourcing of middle class jobs to Ireland and India, Hurricane Katrina, the financial crisis and the Great Recession. At each turn in the road, reporters and commentators concerned about rising income inequality but dismayed by the lack of political attention given to the issue declared that finally it would be taken seriously. And this says nothing of the events prior to the 2000s, several of which pointed the finger at rising inequality just as vehemently, as I show in my analysis of media coverage of income inequality in chapter 3. Yet nothing has changed. Income inequality continues its rise to heights unfathomable just a few generations ago. The late public intellectual and eminent Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell wrote in 1973 that earnings inequality "will be one of the most vexing questions in a post-industrial society."

Utilizing a sample of attenders and their congregations from the 2008/2009 U.S. Congregational Life Survey, a national survey representative of American congregations, this study uses multilevel models to examine the relationships that congregational involvement, private devotional activities, and congregational context have with providing social support.

Despite its use by leading health organizations, the performance of this method in realistic situations is still largely unknown. We evaluated respondent-driven sampling by comparing estimates from a respondent-driven sampling survey with total-population data. Methods\textemdash Total-population data on age, tribe, religion, socioeconomic status, sexual activity and HIV status were available on a population of 2402 male household-heads from an open cohort in rural Uganda. A respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey was carried out in this population, employing current methods of sampling (RDS sample) and statistical inference (RDS estimates). Analyses were carried out for the full RDS sample and then repeated for the first 250 recruits (small sample). Results\textemdash We recruited 927 household-heads. Full and small RDS samples were largely representative of the total population, but both samples under-represented men who were younger, of higher socioeconomic status, and with unknown sexual activity and HIV status. Respondentdriven-sampling statistical-inference methods failed to reduce these biases. Only 31\%-37\% (depending on method and sample size) of RDS estimates were closer to the true population proportions than the RDS sample proportions. Only 50\%-74\% of respondent-driven-sampling bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals included the population proportion. Conclusions\textemdash Respondent-driven sampling produced a generally representative sample of this well-connected non-hidden population. However, current respondent-driven-sampling inference methods failed to reduce bias when it occurred. Whether the data required to remove bias and},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Binge-eating disorder (BED), a public health problem associated with psychopathological symptoms and obesity and possibly with metabolic syndrome, lacks approved pharmacotherapies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a dextroamphetamine prodrug, to treat moderate to severe BED. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, forced dose titration, placebo-controlled clinical trial at 30 sites from May 10, 2011, through January 30, 2012. Safety and intention-to-treat analyses included 259 and 255 adults with BED, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate at dosages of 30, 50, or 70 mg/d or placebo were provided to study participants (1:1:1:1). Dosages were titrated across 3 weeks and maintained for 8 weeks. We followed up participants for a mean (SD) of 7 (2) days after the last dose. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed the change in binge-eating (BE) behaviors measured as days per week (baseline to week 11) with a mixed-effects model using transformed log (BE days per week)\,+\,1. Secondary measures included BE cessation for 4 weeks. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and change in weight. RESULTS: At week 11, log-transformed BE days per week decreased with the 50-mg/d (least squares [LS] mean [SE] change, -1.49 [0.066]; P\,=\,.008) and 70-mg/d (LS mean [SE] change, -1.57 [0.067]; P\,{$<$}\,.001) treatment groups but not the 30-mg/d treatment group (LS mean [SE] change, -1.24 [0.067]; P\,=\,.88) compared with the placebo group. Nontransformed mean (SD) days per week decreased for placebo and the 30-, 50-, and 70-mg/d treatment groups by -3.3 (2.04), -3.5 (1.95), -4.1 (1.52), and -4.1 (1.57), respectively. The percentage of participants achieving 4-week BE cessation was lower with the placebo group (21.3\%) compared with the 50-mg/d (42.2\% [P\,=\,.01]) and 70-mg/d (50.0\% [P\,{$<$}\,.001]) treatment groups. The incidence of any treatment-emergent adverse events was 58.7\% for the placebo group and 84.7\% for the combined treatment group. In the treatment groups, 1.5\% of participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse effects. Events with a frequency of at least 5\% and changes in heart rate were generally consistent with the known safety profile. The mean (SD) change in body weight was -0.1 (3.09), -3.1 (3.64), -4.9 (4.43), -4.9 (3.93), and -4.3 (4.09) kg for the placebo group, the 30-, 50-, and 70-mg/d treatment groups, and the combined treatment groups, respectively (P\,{$<$}\,.001 for each dose vs placebo group comparison in post hoc analysis). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups demonstrated efficacy compared with the placebo group in decreased BE days, BE cessation, and global improvement. The safety profile was generally consistent with previous findings in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Further investigation of lisdexamfetamine in BED is ongoing.

The sample was 66.46\% female with a mean age of 34.36 years (SD = 14.13 years) and consistent with the general U.S. population in terms of geographic distribution. Information on ethnicity was not available. The size of the sample permitted both scale- and item-level analyses. The scale-level analyses produced findings similar to those of previous studies, but raised concerns about multidimensionality in the scales. Item-level analyses suggested an alternate set of 24 scales, 20 of which overlapped substantially with existing VIA-IS scales. A second-order analysis suggested five factors, including a new one labeled Future Orientation, versus the original six virtues proposed in the development of the VIA-IS.The results were used to speculate about elements of a second-generation model of strengths.},

We argue that family structure has become an important mechanism for the reproduction of class, race, and gender inequalities. We review studies of income inequality and family structure changes and find a wide range of estimates of the correlation. We discuss how increases in income inequality may lead to increases in single motherhood, particularly among less educated women. Single motherhood in turn decreases intergenerational economic mobility by affecting children's material resources and the parenting they experience. Because of the unequal distribution of family structure by race and the negative effects of single motherhood, family structure changes exacerbate racial inequalities. Gender inequalities also increase as mothers incur more child-related costs and fewer fathers experience family life with children.},

This principle\textemdash the homophily principle\textemdash structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

  abstract = {Objective:  To explore adolescent mental health in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, scene of a complex emergency since 1996. Design:  Community cross-sectional data obtained using a cluster sample approach. Setting:  From November 5, 2007, through February 5, 2008, we assessed 13 secondary schools in 4 selected health zones in the Ituri district. Participants:  One thousand forty-six adolescents and young adults aged 13 to 21 years completed a self-report questionnaire. Main Exposures:  War-related traumatic events, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and sociodemographic variables. Main Outcomes Measures:  The Adolescent Complex Emergency Exposure Scale, specifically designed for this region, screened for exposure to potentially traumatic events, and the Impact of Event Scale\textendash Revised measured symptoms of posttraumatic stress consistent with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria. Results:  Among the 477 girls (45.6\%) and 569 boys (54.4\%) in the study, 95.0\% reported at least 1 traumatic event. On average, adolescents were exposed to 4.71 traumatic events, with higher exposure rates reported in boys, older groups, rural and urban areas, and respondents whose mother or father was dead. Of 990 respondents, 52.2\% met symptom criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. Symptom scores were strongly related to cumulative trauma exposure; however, the strength of this relationship differed slightly across living area groups for girls. Conclusion:  Adolescents in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are highly exposed to political violence, putting them at a considerable risk\textemdash mediated by living area and sex\textemdash to develop posttraumatic stress symptoms. Since 1996, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been the center of a complex array of intricate conflicts involving local, national, and international factions. Despite a peace agreement attained in 2003, the eastern provinces remain unstable and volatile making DRC the scene of the world's deadliest crisis since World War II according to mortality figures obtained by the International Rescue Committee. It is estimated that 5.4 million excess deaths have occurred from August 1998 through April 2007, directly related to violence or indirectly through socioeconomical disturbances caused by conflict. We will focus on the Ituri district in eastern DRC, where ethnic tensions, mobilized by several armed actors, induced extensive human rights abuses and killings from 1999 through 2006.3 During the conflict, civilians were targeted for massacre, mutilation, rape, cannibalism, torture, house-to-house raids, or the looting and burning of their houses and sometimes entire villages. These atrocities earned Ituri the notorious name of ``the bloodiest corner in DRC'' and led to the opening of the very first investigation of the International Criminal Court. Moreover, all associated armed groups recruited children for military service, amounting to an estimated 30 000 child soldiers participating in conflicts in the eastern provinces. The violence in Ituri killed more than 60 000 and caused more than 500 000 people to flee, often to encounter further violence and hardship on their way. Approximately 210 000 remain displaced in the Ituri district, and occasional local upsurges of violence continue to create new flows of forced displacement. It is well known that exposure to war-related violence poses a serious threat to the emotional well-being of civilians. With reference to children and adolescents, empirical studies have found convincing proof of the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among other disorders, as a consequence of war atrocities and related human rights violations. Reported prevalence rates grossly range from 22\% to 90\%. However, evidence on the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa\textemdash the region of the world most affected by armed conflict\textemdash is lacking. In the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, a survey by the United Nations Children's Fund found that 95.5\% of the 3030 eight- to 19-year-old individuals interviewed had witnessed violence during the war, and 79\% reached the cutoff score for clinically significant symptoms of PTSD. Exposure rates were similar in an adult sample (94.1\%), whereas 24.8\% were found to meet PTSD symptom criteria. Previous research has found certain factors that mediate the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms in children, which from an ecological framework can be seen as interconnected across microsystems, mesosystems, and macrosystems in the war-affected society. As such, the amount and severity of traumatic exposure being female and the absence of parental support were all found to be positively associated with symptoms. Age has also been discerned as an influencing factor, although its effect appears to vary according to each specific context. However, adolescents often appear to be most afflicted by war violence, while high expectations are imposed on them in the rehabilitation of war-affected societies. This places the psychosocial recovery of adolescents high on the humanitarian and development agenda. We undertook this study to explore the prevalence of traumatic exposure and subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms in adolescents and young adults aged 13 to 21 years on the one hand and mediating factors on the other. Such a screening is perceived as essential to estimate the impact of the Ituri crisis on mental health and to inform planning for intervention in its early recovery phase. On the basis of previous research findings on the effects of war on child mental health, we hypothesized that cumulative traumatic exposure is associated with higher symptom levels (a dose-effect relationship). Also, we expected sex, the death of parents, age, and living area to affect exposure rates and symptom levels.},

Task-sharing (also, taskshifting), where mental health care is provided by non-specialists, has been proposed to improve access to mental health care in LMICs. This multi-site qualitative study investigates the acceptability and feasibility of task-sharing mental health care in LMICs by examining perceptions of primary care service providers (physicians, nurses, and community health workers), community members, and service users in one district in each of the five countries participating in the PRogramme for Improving Mental health carE (PRIME): Ethiopia, India, Nepal, South Africa, and Uganda. Thirty-six focus group discussions and 164 in-depth interviews were conducted at the pre-implementation stage between February and October 2012 with the objective of developing district level plans to integrate mental health care into primary care. Perceptions of the acceptability and feasibility of task-sharing were evaluated first at the district level in each country through open-coding and then at the cross-country level through a secondary analysis of emergent themes. We found that task-sharing mental health services is perceived to be acceptable and feasible in these LMICs as long as key conditions are met: 1) increased numbers of human resources and better access to medications; 2) ongoing structured supportive supervision at the community and primary care-levels; and 3) adequate training and compensation for health workers involved in task-sharing. Taking into account the socio-cultural context is fundamental for identifying local personnel who can assist in detection of mental illness and facilitate treatment and care as well as training, supervision, and service delivery. By recognizing the systemic challenges and sociocultural nuances that may influence task-sharing mental health care, locally-situated interventions could be more easily planned to provide appropriate and acceptable mental health care in LMICs.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have found that burnout is to some extent contagious and have argued it is a socially induced phenomenon. However, until now, actual social interactions and the long-term effect of this contagion have remained largely unexplored. This study aimed to expand earlier findings on burnout contagion through the application of a social network approach. This approach assumes that some relationships provide more information on the feelings and attitudes of others. This study therefore not only identified interaction partners, but also examined how characteristics (multiplexity, frequency, and embeddedness) of the relationship with those partners relate to burnout contagion. Using (temporal) network autocorrelation models, burnout contagion was empirically investigated in the context of secondary school teams. Cross-sectional analyses were performed on data obtained from 931 teachers working in 14 schools. Long-term effects of burnout contagion were assessed among 578 teachers working in 12 schools. The results showed that interpersonal interactions act as conduits for burnout contagion, especially when relations are strong in terms of frequency, embeddedness, and multiplexity. The results also showed that features of relationships play a differential role in the contagion of different components of burnout. Moreover, long-term effects were found for emotional exhaustion. This study thus provided evidence for the importance of interpersonal relationships in burnout contagion. Practitioner points Negative feelings are transmitted through personal interaction: As such, the importance of positive (social) experiences within the school team is stressed. Co-rumination should be avoided as it may impact negatively on employees' well-being in both the short term and the long term. Given the contagious nature of burnout, interventions for preventing and reducing burnout should not be solely focused on increasing social support within the school team. External support might be necessary to disrupt a potential negative cycle within this team.},

We then run recruitment chains over this simulated network to assess the assumption that the RDS chain referral process samples participants in proportion to their degree and the extent to which RDS satisfactorily covers certain parts of the network. We find evidence that, contrary to assumptions, RDS oversamples low degree nodes and geographically central areas of the network. Unlike previous evaluations of RDS which have explored the performance of RDS sampling chains on a non-hidden population, or the performance of simulated chains over previously mapped realistic social networks, our study provides a robust, empirically grounded evaluation of the performance of RDS chains on a real-world hidden population.},

The former leads to an increase in under-reporting associated with the number of days the diary is kept. The latter is related to the number of waves respondents have been participating, so-called panel experience. These biases imply that observed mobility changes between waves are partly due to reporting errors: without controlling for them, changes in mobility can not be inferred from the data. An important cause of these measurement errors is the increase in the number of days on which no trips at all were reported. In addition, shorter trips and less complex chains are more susceptible to underreporting. The methodology used in this paper provides a means of dealing with these problems. Attrition is taken into account by a rather simple measure. The paper concludes with a number of suggestions for sample and survey design.},

We recruited 10 caregivers from support groups, the Alzheimer's Association, and local community-based organizations in Northern California. We conducted semistructured in-depth interviews with all caregivers, as well as a focus group to obtain ideas about supportive strategies. Several themes emerged from the data: (a) Filial piety was influential in caregiving; (b) A sense of loss/grief or trauma was pervasive; and (c) Caregivers had clear sources of stress and sources of support. An overarching theme underlying these 3 topics was that cultural beliefs, values, and expectations impacted the caregiving experience. Suggestions for promising interventions included education, language-congruent and/or telephone support groups, case management, inclusion of the care recipient in the intervention, and importance of credibility of the intervention. It also may be valuable to include an understanding of cultural values and promotion of spirituality and religion as key components. Findings highlight targets for dementia caregiver interventions to reduce burden and distress in an understudied population.},

Methods United Methodist clergy in North Carolina (N = 1,513) completed the SF-12 measure of HRQL and items on chronic disease diagnoses, health behaviors, and health care access from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). Differences in HRQL between rural (N = 571) and non-rural clergy (N = 942) were examined using multiple regression analyses. Results Physical HRQL was significantly lower for rural clergy (-2.0; 95\% CI: -2.9 to -1.1; P \textbackslash{} 0.001). Income, body mass index, and joint disease partially accounted for the rural/non-rural difference, though a sizable disparity remained after controlling for these mediators (-1.02; 95\% CI: -1.89 to -.15; P = 0.022). Mental HRQL did not differ significantly between rural and non-rural respondents (1.0, 95\% CI: -0.1 to 2.1; P = 0.067). Conclusions Rural/non-rural disparities in physical HRQL are partially explained by differences in income, obesity, and joint disease in rural areas. More research into},

This study explores the utility of peer support groups for reducing psychological distress among pastors by analyzing data from two waves of an ongoing study of United Methodist Church (UMC) clergy in North Carolina, as well as focus group data from the same population. Results indicate that participation in peer support groups had weakly beneficial direct and indirect relationships to psychological distress (measured as mentally unhealthy days, anxiety, and depression). Focus group data indicated that the weak results may be due to an interplay between varied group activities and differences in individual coping styles, which in turn lead to a mix of positive and negative group experiences. The results caution against assuming that peer groups are a uniformly effective solution to the occupational demands of pastoral work.},

This meta-analysis showed that much of the variability is attributable to stressor and person features. Timing is an especially critical element, as hormonal activity is elevated at stressor onset but reduces as time passes. Stressors that threaten physical integrity, involve trauma, and are uncontrollable elicit a high, flat diurnal profile of cortisol secretion. Finally, HPA activity is shaped by a person's response to the situation; it increases with subjective distress but is lower in persons with posttraumatic stress disorder.},

However, it turns out that this posterior is not consistent \textemdash{} it does not concentrate at the true number of components. In this note, we give an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a DPM with normal components of unit variance, applied to data from a ``mixture'' with one standard normal component. Further, we show that this example exhibits severe inconsistency: instead of going to 1, the posterior probability that there is one cluster converges (in probability) to 0.},

The authors argue that trauma-focused advocates tend to overemphasize the impact of direct war exposure on mental health, and fail to consider the contribution of stressful social and material conditions (daily stressors). Drawing on the findings of recent studies that have examined the relationship of both war exposure and daily stressors to mental health status, a model is proposed in which daily stressors partially mediate the relationship of war exposure to mental health. Based on that model, and on the growing body of research that supports it, an integrative, sequenced approach to intervention is proposed in which daily stressors are first addressed, and specialized interventions are then provided for individuals whose distress does not abate with the repair of the social ecology.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of extreme obesity continues to increase among adults in the US, yet there is an absence of subnational estimates and geographic description of extreme obesity. This shortcoming prevents a thorough understanding of the geographic distribution of extreme obesity, which in turn limits the ability of public health agencies and policy makers to target areas with a known higher prevalence.To use small-area estimation to create county-level estimates of extreme obesity in the US and apply spatial methods to identify clusters of high and low prevalence.A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using multilevel regression and poststratification with data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the US Census Bureau to create prevalence estimates of county-level extreme obesity (body mass index {$\geq$}40 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared]). Data were included on adults (aged {$\geq$}18 years) living in the contiguous US. Analysis was performed from June 4 to December 28, 2018.Multilevel logistic regression models estimated the probability of extreme obesity based on individual-level and area-level characteristics. Census counts were multiplied by these probabilities and summed by county to create county-level prevalence estimates. Moran index values were calculated to assess spatial autocorrelation and identify spatial clusters of hot and cold spots. Estimates of moderate obesity were obtained for comparison.Overall, the weighted prevalence of extreme obesity was 4.0\% (95\% CI, 3.9\%-4.1\%) and the prevalence of moderate obesity was 23.7\% (95\% CI, 23.4\%-23.9\%). County-level prevalence of extreme obesity ranged from 1.3\% (95\% CI, 1.3\%-1.3\%) to 15.7\% (95\% CI, 15.3\%-16.0\%). The Pearson correlation coefficient comparing model-predicted estimates with direct estimates was 0.81 (P\,\&lt;\,.001). The Moran index I score was 0.35 (P\,\&lt;\,.001), indicating spatial clustering. Significant clusters of high and low prevalence were identified. Hot spots indicating clustering of high prevalence of extreme obesity in several regions, including the Mississippi Delta region and the Southeast, were identified, as well as clusters of low prevalence in the Rocky Mountain region and the Northeast.Substantial geographic variation was identified in the prevalence of extreme obesity; there was considerable county-level variation even in states generally known as having high or low prevalence of obesity. The results suggest that extreme obesity prevalence demonstrates spatial dependence and clustering and may support the need for substate analysis and benefit of disaggregation of obesity by group. Findings from this study can inform local and national policies seeking to identify populations most at risk from very high body mass index.},

Also, higher levels of religious participation are associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms and work distress. Some have argued that religious participation is a proxy for social support, rather than an independent variable. In order to study the independent association of religious participation with depressive symptoms and occupational distress, this longitudinal study of 895 United Methodist clergy measured the prospective relationships of spiritual well-being, depressive symptoms, and occupational distress, while controlling for a measure of social support. As expected, spiritual well-being, depressive symptoms and occupational distress were all significantly correlated at Time 1. Residualized change linear regression models assessed their prospective effects between Time 1 and Time 2 (1 year later). Higher levels of spiritual well-being were protective against increased depressive symptoms, even when controlling for perceived emotional support. In addition, lower levels of depressive symptoms were protective against increased occupational distress. Surprisingly, occupational distress did not predict depressive symptoms. Neither occupational distress nor depressive symptoms predicted spiritual well-being. The findings indicate a longitudinal and directional pattern, with lower spiritual well-being predicting depressive symptoms, which in turn predicted occupational distress. These findings suggest future intervention research for clergy, with a focus on spiritual well-being, and an overall goal of reducing depression and improving occupational function. More broadly, the results support an effect of spiritual well-being independent of social support. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

An internal orientation to the demands of ministry (where ministers depend on internal sources of authority and coping, such as spirituality and competence) is associated with low burnout in cross-sectional studies of ministers. However, little is known about stressors in early ministry and whether an internal ministry orientation is associated with burnout over the first year of ministry. Sixty graduating theological students completed demographic items, exploratory questions relating to the psychological effects of secularization, and measures of burnout, personality, and orientation to ministry. Most of these measures, together with ratings of stress and coping, were repeated after 12 months. Burnout increased over time in ministry, and ministers reported that ministry and relational issues were most stressful. Those with only a weakly internal orientation to ministry demands experienced higher levels of burnout on exit from theological college, and after 12 months. The results support a prediction from secularization theory, that the declining authority of ministers will have important consequences for their psychological health.},

Or do they merely report the feelings in standard indexes more frequently? Perhaps women discuss their emotions more freely. Or perhaps the indexes tap "feminine" emotions such as depression rather than "masculine" ones such as anger. This study analyzes data from a 1990 U.S. sample of 1,282 women and 749 men. Results show that men keep emotions to themselves more than women, and that women express emotions more freely than men. However, these factors do not explain the effect of sex on reported levels of distress--an effect that remains significant with adjustment for these factors. Our results also contradict the idea that the sex difference in distress would diminish if the indexes of distress contained more items that tap anger. Adjusting for emotional reserve and expressiveness, women experience anger more often than men, as they do sadness, anxiety, malaise, and aches. In fact, being female has twice the effect on the frequency of anger that it has on the frequency of sadness. Women report feeling happy as often as men, but adjusting for emotional expressiveness reveals a negative effect of being female on happiness. Overall, women experience distress about 30 percent more often than men. We discuss the possibility that drug abuse and heavy drinking mask male distress, but find little evidence that those behaviors ameliorate distress. We conclude that women genuinely suffer more distress than men.},

The major forms of distress are malaise (such as lethargy, headaches, and trembling hands), anxiety (such as feeling afraid, worried, or irritable), and depression (such as feeling sad, worthless, or hopeless).

We investigated whether haematological response to repeated acute mental stress would habituate and be sustained 45 min and 105 min after stress. Twenty-four men underwent a 13-min stressor three times, one week apart; hematological variables were measured at week one and three. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and thrombocytes all increased from rest to immediately post-stress (p's{$<$}.001). After 105 min of recovery, leukocytes and platelets both were higher, and hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes were all lower than at rest (p's{$<$}.001 to {$<$}.05). At all time points, hematocrit (p=.005) and erythrocytes (p=.006) were lower at week three than at week one. In contrast to an attenuation in systolic blood pressure increase from rest to immediately post-stress (p{$<$}.001), and in cortisol recovery from immediately post-stress to 45 min post-stress (p{$<$}.001), the magnitude of change in hemoconcentration and cell counts in stress and recovery experienced no habituation. Adjustment for stress-induced plasma volume shift altered findings: Elevated leukocytes post-stress persisted at 105 min (p{$<$}.001); any changes in lymphocytes became insignificant; erythrocytes decreased from rest to post-stress (p{$<$}.001) to increase again during recovery (p's{$<$}.05); platelets increased linearly between rest and 105 min of recovery (p=.005). We conclude that the magnitude of changes in hemoconcentration and blood cells during acute mental stress and recovery failed to habituate to stress repeats and, in part, sustained up to 105 min.

Results Low perceived ISS correlated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, social phobia and several physical health problems. There was a strong association between excellent self-perceived physical health and high social support. Conclusions There was evidence for both the main, beneficial effects of high perceived ISS and buffering, whereby increased perceived ISS ameliorated the pathogenic influence of exposure to traumatic life events on psychopathology. Current findings highlight the importance of perceived ISS in individuals' general mental and physical well-being, both in daily life and upon exposure to negative life events.},

Given the availability of flexible software for analyzing longitudinal sequences of unequal length, implementation of likelihood-based MAR analyses is not limited by computational considerations. While such analyses are valid under the comparatively weak assumption of MAR, the possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) is difficult to rule out. It is argued, however, that MNAR analyses are, themselves, surrounded with problems and therefore, rather than ignoring MNAR analyses altogether or blindly shifting to them, their optimal place is within sensitivity analysis. The concepts developed here are illustrated using data from three clinical trials, where it is shown that the analysis method may have an impact on the conclusions of the study.},

Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a brief dualpurpose instrument yielding DSM-IV diagnoses and severity, and PHQ-2, an ultra-brief screening tool, offer advantages in resource-constrained settings. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity/reliability of PHQ-9 and PHQ-2. DESIGN: Observational, two occasions 7 days apart. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 347 patients attending psychosocial support groups. MEASUREMENTS: Demographics, PHQ-9, PHQ-2, general health perception rating and CD4 count. RESULTS: Rates for PHQ-9 DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD), other depressive disorder (ODD) and any depressive disorder were 13\%, 21\% and 34\%. Depression was associated with female gender, but not CD4. Construct validity was supported by: (1) a strong association between PHQ-9 and general health rating, (2) a single major factor with loadings exceeding 0.50, (3) item-total correlations exceeding 0.37 and (4) a pattern of item means similar to US validation studies. Four focus groups indicated culturally relevant content validity and minor modifications to the PHQ-9 instructions. Coefficient alpha was 0.78. Test-retest reliability was acceptable: (1) intraclass correlation 0.59 for PHQ-9 total score, (2) kappas 0.24, 0.25 and 0.38 for PHQ-9 MDD, ODD and any depressive disorder and (3) weighted kappa 0.53 for PHQ-9 depression severity categories. PHQ-2 {$\geq$}3 demonstrated high sensitivity (85\%) and specificity (95\%) for diagnosing any PHQ-9 depressive disorder (AUC, 0.97), and 91\% and 77\%, respectively, for diagnosing PHQ-9 MDD (AUC, 0.91). Psychometrics were also good within four gender/age (18\textendash 35, 36\textendash 61) subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 appear valid/ reliable for assessing DSM-IV depressive disorders},

Clinically, a decrease in heart rate variability is correlated to higher morbidity and mortality in diverse conditions, from heart disease to foetal distress. It is usually attributed to fluctuation in cardiac autonomic nerve activity. We calculated heart rate variability parameters from a variety of cardiac preparations (including humans, living animals, Langendorff-perfused heart and single sinoatrial nodal cell) in diverse species, combining this with data from previously published papers. We show that regardless of conditions, there is a universal exponential decay-like relationship between heart rate variability and heart rate. Using two biophysical models, we develop a theory for this, and confirm that heart rate variability is primarily dependent on heart rate and cannot be used in any simple way to assess autonomic nerve activity to the heart. We suggest that the correlation between a change in heart rate variability and altered morbidity and mortality is substantially attributable to the concurrent change in heart rate. This calls for re-evaluation of the findings from many papers that have not adjusted properly or at all for heart rate differences when comparing heart rate variability in multiple circumstances.},

Here, we aimed to determine the most appropriate experimental approach to the TSST-VR when investigating the modulation of the axes involved in the stress response. We compared the use of goggles versus a screen projection in the TSST-VR paradigm. Forty-five healthy participants were divided into two groups: the first one (goggles condition; 13 females, 11 males) wore goggles while performing the TSST-VR; the second (screen condition; 15 females, six males) was exposed to the TSST-VR projected on a screen. Sympathetic reactivity to stress was measured by continuously recording skin conductance (SC), while the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) was evaluated by sampling salivary cortisol throughout the experiment. At the end of the task, there was an increase in SC and cortisol level for both means of delivering the TSST-VR, although the increase in SC was greater in the goggles condition, while salivary cortisol was comparable in both groups. Immersion levels were reportedly higher in the screen presentation than in the goggles group. In terms of sex differences, females experienced greater involvement and spatial presence, though comparatively less experienced realism, than their male counterparts. These findings help us determine which protocol of the TSST-VR is most suitable for the stress response under study. They also emphasize the need to consider the sex of participants, as males and females show distinct responses in each protocol.},

  abstract = {Clergy believe they have been called to be healthy and role models of good health. However, epidemiological evidence supports that clergy are currently exhibiting higher rates of chronic diseases and associated factors such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension compared to the general population. Prior studies of clergy's health are limited because the few available studies are denomination specific, limiting generalizability to the other denominations who have differing theology and beliefs. The Wesleyan denomination has not been formally studied. The gap in literature, therefore, creates a need for baseline information specific to the Wesleyan clergy. This cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of chronic diseases, associated factors, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among a sample (n = 301) of Wesleyan clergy using the Wilson-Cleary Model of Health-Related Quality of Life as theoretical framework. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample. Prevalence rates were calculated for the chronic diseases examined, while Chi-square analysis assessed the associations between disease prevalence and associated factors. Mann-Whitney U test assessed urban-rural difference in Wesleyan clergy HRQOL, and differences between the HRQOL's categories by number of diseases. Majority (80\%) of the clergy reported being overweight or obese but did not report higher rates of chronic disease normally associated when compared to the general population. There were significant associations between factors such as overweight/obesity, hypertension, or high cholesterol and the prevalence of chronic diseases (diabetes, pre-diabetes, CHD, heart attack, stroke, depression, arthritis, skin cancer, other cancer. Clergy living in rural settings exhibited lower scores in all domains of HRQOL when compared to those living in urban settings, and those having one or more chronic diseases had lower HRQOL measures. These study findings suggest an urgent need to create targeted health interventions for Wesleyan clergy in order to improve their overall health status and boost retention of clergy in the Wesleyan Church.},

  abstract = {Wearable physiological monitors have become increasingly popular, often worn during people's daily life, collecting data 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In the last decade, these devices have attracted the attention of the scientific community as they allow us to automatically extract information about user physiology (e.g., heart rate, sleep quality and physical activity) enabling inference on their health. However, the biggest issue about the data recorded by wearable devices is the missing values due to motion and mechanical artifacts induced by external stimuli during data acquisition. This missing data could negatively affect the assessment of heart rate (HR) response and estimation of heart rate variability (HRV), that could in turn provide misleading insights concerning the health status of the individual. In this study, we focus on healthy subjects with normal heart activity and investigate the effects of missing variation of the timing between beats (RR-intervals) caused by motion artifacts on HRV features estimation by randomly introducing missing values within a five min time windows of RR-intervals obtained from the nsr2db PhysioNet dataset by using Gilbert burst method. We then evaluate several strategies for estimating HRV in the presence of missing values by interpolating periods of missing values, covering the range of techniques often deployed in the literature, via linear, quadratic, cubic, and cubic spline functions. We thereby compare the HRV features obtained by handling missing data in RR-interval time series against HRV features obtained from the same data without missing values. Finally, we assess the difference between the use of interpolation methods on time (i.e., the timestamp when the heartbeats happen) and on duration (i.e., the duration of the heartbeats), in order to identify the best methodology to handle the missing RR-intervals. The main novel finding of this study is that the interpolation of missing data on time produces more reliable HRV estimations when compared to interpolation on duration. Hence, we can conclude that interpolation on duration modifies the power spectrum of the RR signal, negatively affecting the estimation of the HRV features as the amount of missing values increases. We can conclude that interpolation in time is the optimal method among those considered for handling data with large amounts of missing values, such as data from wearable sensors.},

We use these data to investigate the stability of both overall networks and individual ties, as well as the linkage between the stability of individual ties and the stability of the network's aggregate properties. We fmd that instability in these networks is best thought of in terms of an underlying 'core-periphery' structure, whereby some network members are likely to be named repeatedly (the core), while others are relatively unlikely to appear in any given elicitation of the network (the periphery). We explore the implications of this core-periphery structure for cross-sectional elicitations of personal networks.},

  abstract = {Objective The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a widely used screening tool for major depressive disorder (MDD), although there is debate surrounding its diagnostic properties. For the PHQ-9, we aimed to: 1. Establish the diagnostic performance at the standard cutoff point (10). 2. Compare the diagnostic performance at the standard cutoff point in different clinical settings. 3. Assess whether there is selective reporting of cutoff points other than 10. Methods We searched three databases \textemdash{} Embase, MEDLINE and PSYCHInfo \textemdash{} and performed a reverse citation search in Web of Science. We selected for inclusion studies of any design that assessed the PHQ-9 in adult populations against recognized gold-standard instruments for the diagnosis of either Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases criteria for major depression. Included studies had to report sufficient information to calculate 2*2 contingency tables. Data extraction and synthesis were performed independently by two researchers. For the included studies, we calculated pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, positive likelihood, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio for cutoff points 7 to 15. Results Thirty-six studies (21,292 patients) met inclusion criteria. Pooled sensitivity for cutoff point 10 was 0.78 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.70\textendash 0.84], and pooled specificity was 0.87 (95\% CI, 0.84\textendash 0.90). At this cutoff, the PHQ-9 is a better screener in primary care than secondary care settings. No conclusions could be drawn at cutoff points other than 10 due to selective reporting of data. Conclusions For MDD, the PHQ-9 has acceptable diagnostic properties at cutoff point 10 in different settings. We recommend that future studies report the full range of cutoff points to allow exploration of optimal cutoff points in different settings.},

  abstract = {Is the United States justified in seeing itself as a meritocracy, where stark inequalities in pay and employment reflect differences in skills, education,and effort? Or does racial discrimination still permeate the labor market, resulting in the systematic under hiring and underpaying of racial minorities, regardless of merit? Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s African Americans have lost ground to whites in the labor market, but this widening racial inequality is most often attributed to economic restructuring, not the racial attitudes of employers. It is argued that the educational gap between blacks and whites, though narrowing, carries greater penalties now that we are living in an era of global trade and technological change that favors highly educated workers and displaces the low-skilled. Stories Employers Tell demonstrates that this conventional wisdom is incomplete. Racial discrimination is still a fundamental part of the explanation of labor market disadvantage. Drawing upon a wide-ranging survey of employers in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles, Moss and Tilly investigate the types of jobs employers offer, the skills required, and the recruitment, screening and hiring procedures used to fill them. The authors then follow up in greater depth on selected employers to explore the attitudes, motivations, and rationale underlying their hiring decisions, as well as decisions about where to locate a business. Moss and Tilly show how an employer's perception of the merit or suitability of a candidate is often colored by racial stereotypes and culture-bound expectations. The rising demand for soft skills, such as communication skills and people skills, opens the door to discrimination that is rarely overt, or even conscious, but is nonetheless damaging to the prospects of minority candidates and particularly difficult to police. Some employers expressed a concern to race-match employees with the customers they are likely to be dealing with. As more jobs require direct interaction with the public, race has become increasingly important in determining labor market fortunes. Frequently, employers also take into account the racial make-up of neighborhoods when deciding where to locate their businesses. Ultimately, it is the hiring decisions of employers that determine whether today's labor market reflects merit or prejudice. This book, the result of years of careful research, offers us a rare opportunity to view the issue of discrimination through the employers' eyes.

  abstract = {Many analysts argue colorblindness as the reigning ideological buttress of a historically distinct form of structural white supremacy, color-blind racism. In contrast to slavery and legal segregation, color-blind racism is theorized as covert and highly institutionalized. As such, analyses of contemporary racial reproduction often emphasize the structure of colorblindness, particularly the habitual routines and discursive patterns of everyday white actors. Though invaluable, this work may conceal whites' innovation in reproducing, revising, and at times resisting white supremacy and corresponding logics. As opposed to focusing on the structural elements of colorblindness, I elevate colorblindness as a culturally recursive accomplishment grounded in an epistemology of ignorance\textemdash that is a process of knowing designed to produce not knowing surrounding white privilege and structural white supremacy. Qualitatively analyzing 105 family wealth analyses produced by white college undergraduates researching racial inequality and the wealth gap, I identify four epistemic maneuvers by which students creatively repaired a breach in normative colorblindness. Demonstrating innovative means by which ordinary whites bypass and mystify racial learning highlights their vested commitment to maintaining and creatively defending the ideologies that buttress racial domination and white supremacy. As such, this research additionally advises updating strategies for challenging whites' colorblindness in efforts to advance racial justice.},

These trends have been identified as a public health crisis in urgent need of new solutions and have spurred significant research efforts to improve our understanding of suicide and strategies to prevent it. Unfortunately, despite making significant contributions to the founding of suicidology \textendash{} through Emile Durkheim's classic Suicide (1897/1951) \textendash{} sociology's role has been less prominent in contemporary efforts to address these tragic trends, though as we will show, sociological theories offer great promise for advancing our understanding of suicide and improving the efficacy of suicide prevention. Here, we review sociological theory and empirical research on suicide. We begin where all sociologists must: with Durkheim. However, we offer a more comprehensive understanding of Durkheim's insights into suicide than the prior reviews provided by those in other disciplines. In so doing, we reveal the nuance and richness of Durkheim's insights that have been largely lost in modern suicidology, despite being foundational to all sociological theories of suicide \textendash{} even those that have moved beyond his model. We proceed to discuss broadly acknowledged limitations to Durkheim's theory of suicide and review how more recent theoretical efforts have not only addressed those concerns, but have done so by bringing a larger swatch of sociology's theoretical and empirical toolkit to bare on suicide. Specifically, we review how recent sociological theories of suicide have incorporated insights from social network theories, cultural sociology, sociology of emotions, and sociological social psychology to better theorize how the external social world matters to individual psychological pain and suffering. We conclude by making explicit bridges between sociological and psychological theories of suicide; by noting important limitations in knowledge about suicide \textendash{} particularly regarding the roles of organizations, inequality, and intersectionality in suicide \textendash{} that sociology is well situated to help address.},

  abstract = {Informal caregivers worldwide are faced with the dilemma of maintaining their health and meeting the caregiving demands of their loved ones. This study explores the health outcomes of caregiving, caregivers' health-promoting practices and the challenges to providing care among caregivers to children orphaned by AIDS in southwest Uganda. A descriptive design and interview questionnaires were used to collect data from 204 caregivers. The average age of the caregivers was 41.36 ({$\pm$}10.9) years and most of them (53\%) were grandmothers to the orphans. The majority (65\%) of the caregivers were caring for at least three orphans, had been in the caregiver role for more than five years (61\%), and stated that their health had been negatively impacted by caregiving (61\%). According to self-reports, the most common new health problems since taking up the caregiving role were chronic ill health (97\%), social isolation (95\%) and mental stress (92\%). The health-promoting practices most often engaged in were eating a balanced diet (67\%), seeking spiritual support (58\%), and performing self-care activities (44\%). The challenges to caregiving most often reported were poverty (88\%) and a lack of time to seek personal medical care (59\%). The predictors of self-reported poor health among the caregivers were stress (odds ratio [OR] = 3.43; p {$\leq$} 0.01), caring for three or more orphans (OR = 2.19; p {$\leq$} 0.01), female gender (OR = 1.77; p {$\leq$} 0.01), and having spent more than five years as a caregiver to an orphan (OR = 1.35; p {$\leq$} 0.01). The findings suggest that caregivers commonly experience poor health and their health-promoting practices are inadequate. There is a need for organised and formal health-promotion programmes for caregivers of children orphaned by AIDS, especially in rural areas of developing countries. Interventions for health promotion can be achieved through integrated programmes that provide health education, social services, respite from caregiving and counselling.},

As evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of certain specific interventions begins to accumulate, guidelines are needed for how to train, supervise, and ideally sustain mental health treatment delivery by local providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Model and case presentations: This paper presents an apprenticeship model for lay counselor training and supervision in mental health treatments in LMIC, developed and used by the authors in a range of mental health intervention studies conducted over the last decade in various low-resource settings. We describe the elements of this approach, the underlying logic, and provide examples drawn from our experiences working in 12 countries, with over 100 lay counselors. Evaluation: We review the challenges experienced with this model, and propose some possible solutions. Discussion: We describe and discuss how this model is consistent with, and draws on, the broader dissemination and implementation (DI) literature. Conclusion: In our experience, the apprenticeship model provides a useful framework for implementation of mental health interventions in LMIC. Our goal in this paper is to provide sufficient details about the apprenticeship model to guide other training efforts in mental health interventions.},

Caregivers explained their role in raising healthy children as complex and complicated by poverty, stigma, and isolation. Caregivers discussed the effects of their own mental health on child well-being as primarily emotional and behavioral, and explained how looking after a child could bring distress, particularly when unable to provide desired care for sick children. Our findings suggest the need for investigation of the reciprocal effects of child sickness on caregiver wellness and for integrated programs that holistically address the needs of HIV-affected families.},

This paper discusses the analysis of an extended finite mixture model where the latent classes corresponding to the mixture components for one set of observed variables influence a second set of observed variables. The research is motivated by a repeated measurement study using a random coefficient model to assess the influence of latent growth trajectory class membership on the probability of a binary disease outcome. More generally, this model can be seen as a combination of latent class modeling and conventional mixture modeling. The EM algorithm is used for estimation. As an illustration, a random-coefficient growth model for the prediction of alcohol dependence from three latent classes of heavy alcohol use trajectories among young adults is analyzed.},

Study Design and Setting A large-scale analytical cross-sectional population-based survey was performed in 2007 in Kisantu. After extensive sensitization, the study sample was collected using a modified World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise strategy, taking subsequently a random sample of streets, households within streets, and inhabitants aged 20 years and older within households. After informed consent, subjects were invited to fixed sites for interview, anthropometry, clinical examination (blood pressure, monofilament, and ophthalmology), and biochemical tests (fasting capillary glucose, serum creatinine, and albuminuria). Fasting glycemia was repeated or 2-hour postload glycemia was measured the next day in subjects with an initial glycemia of 126\textendash 199 mg/dL (7.0\textendash 11.1 mmol/L) or 100\textendash 125 mg/dL (5.6\textendash 6.9 mmol/L), respectively. Hence, prevalence of diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance according to both 2006 WHO/International Diabetes Federation and 2003 American Diabetes Association criteria could be evaluated. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for statistical analyses. Results Response rate was 93.7\% (1,898 of 2,025). Complete data were available in 1,866 (92.1\%) subjects.

The authors seek to strengthen the current understanding of this trend by providing a deeper theoretical explanation for how identity and mass communications have contributed to the international political dynamic that we live in today. The authors will first provide a brief review of relevant recent scholarship on the aforementioned factors seen to be the cause of the current populism trend. They will follow by examining the history of political and group identities in order to identify the ways in which these identities form the building blocks for nationalism and xenophobia, consequences of the rise of rightwing populism. Next, the authors will explain the methods by which people or groups utilize communication to influence others and achieve power. This will include an in-depth discussion of the historical value of narratives and modern communications theories. This will provide a foundational understanding for the final section, in which the authors discuss modern techniques for influencing narratives and effectively communicating to achieve power, including different types of hacking and election-meddling. Ultimately the authors advocate for the strategic utilization of narratives to promote compassion and affection, given the lethality of a future dominated by misinformation and international interference in the democratic process.},

Short valid depression screening measures may improve detection of depression. We describe the validation of the Luganda translated nine- and two-item Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9 and PHQ-2) as screening tools for depression in two rural primary care facilities in Eastern Uganda. Methods. A total of 1407 adult respondents were screened consecutively using the nine-item Luganda PHQ. Of these 212 were randomly selected to respond to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview diagnostic questionnaire. Descriptive statistics for respondents' demographic characteristics and PHQ scores were generated. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values (PPVs), and area under the ROC curve were determined for both the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2. Results. The optimum trade-off between sensitivity and PPV was at a cut-off of {$\geqq$}5. The weighted area under the receiver Operating Characteristic curve was 0.74 (95\% CI 0.60\textendash 0.89) and 0.68 (95\% CI 0.54\textendash 0.82) for PHQ-9 and PHQ-2, respectively. Conclusion. The Luganda translation of the PHQ-9 was found to be modestly useful in detecting depression. The PHQ9 performed only slightly better than the PHQ-2 in this rural Ugandan Primary care setting. Future research could improve on diagnostic accuracy by considering the idioms of distress among Luganda speakers, and revising the PHQ-9 accordingly. The usefulness of the PHQ-2 in this rural population should be viewed with caution.},

  abstract = {Among the factors making recognition of severe depression problematic for clinicians are the heterogeneous nature of the condition, lack of standardized definitions, and concomitant comorbidities that confound differential diagnosis of symptoms. The spectrum of severity in depressive disorders is extraordinarily broad, and severity assessment is comprised of several metrics including symptom intensity, diagnostic subtypes, suicidality risk, and hospitalization status. The overall diagnosis is achieved through consideration of symptom types and severities together with the degree of functional impairment as assessed by the psychiatric interview. It is likely that no single fundamental neurobiological defect underlies severe depression. The chronicity and heterogeneity of this disorder lead to frequent clinic visits and a longer course of treatment; therefore, successful approaches may require an arsenal of treatments with numerous mechanisms of action. The categories of drugs used to treat severe depression are detailed herein, as are several non-pharmacologic options including a number of experimental treatments. Pharmacotherapies include tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical antidepressants such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and combination and augmentation therapies. Drugs within each class are not equivalent, and efficacy may vary with symptom severity. Patient adherence makes tolerability another critical consideration in antidepressant choice. The role of non-pharmacological treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy, vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and deep brain stimulation remain active avenues of investigation. Improved knowledge and treatment approaches for severe depression are necessary to facilitate remission, the ideal treatment goal.},

The more recent tracks were sex-segregated, and there was evidence of occupational conflation between female clergy in both tracks that did not occur with the male clergy. The evidence suggests that dual ordination tracks may serve a dual utility, not only as an occupational response to socioeconomic changes within religious organizations but also to occupational feminization, in a manner that disproportionately concentrates male clergy in high-level positions.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) has increasingly received attention as a flexible tool to resolve missing data problems both in observational and controlled studies. Our goal has been to develop a valid and efficient MI procedure for the Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Nutrition Study, in which the diet of a cohort of newborn children with HLA-DQB1-conferred susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is repeatedly measured by 3-day food records over early childhood. The estimation of risk is based on a nested case-control design setup within the cohort. We have used an iterative procedure known as the fully conditional specification (FCS) to generate appropriate values for the missing dietary data, here playing the role of time-dependent covariates. Our method extends the standard FCS to repeated measurements settings with the possibility of non-monotone missingness patterns by being doubly iterative over the follow-up time of the individuals. In addition, our proposed procedure is nonparametric in the sense that the variables can have distributions deviating strongly from normality: it makes use of quantile normal scores to transform to normality, performs imputations, and transforms back to the original scale. By the use of a moving time window and stepwise regression procedures, the two-fold FCS method operates well with a great number of variables each measured repeatedly over time. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the procedure together with the proposed transformations and variable selection methods provides tools for valid and efficient statistical inference in the nested case-control setting, and its applications extend beyond that.

As a result, medical schools and professional societies such as the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges are reckoning with their role in perpetuating racial inequality and the impact of structural racism on medical training. Whether these efforts will translate into meaningful change has yet to be determined. Success depends on a deep understanding of the fundamental role racism plays in how medical schools function and an acknowledgment that current organizational structures and processes often serve to entrench, not dismantle, racial inequities. Drawing on racialized organizations theory from the field of sociology, this article gives an overview of scholarship on race and racism in medical training to demonstrate how seemingly race-neutral processes and structures within medical education, in conjunction with individuals' biases and interpersonal discrimination, serve to reproduce and sustain racial inequality. From entrance into medical school through the residency application process, organizational factors such as reliance on standardized tests to predict future success, a hostile learning climate, and racially biased performance metrics ultimately stunt the careers of trainees of color, particularly those from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine (URM). These compounding disadvantages contribute to URM trainees' lower matching odds, steering into less competitive and lucrative specialties, and burnout and attrition from academic careers. In their commitment against structural racism in medical training and academic medicine, medical schools and larger organizations like the Association of American Medical Colleges should prioritize interventions targeted at these structural barriers to achieve equity.},

In this socio-demographic study, 522 unmarried youth 12\textendash 28 years old in rural central Mozambique were surveyed with a structured questionnaire. Using binary logistic regression analysis, we used religious affiliation and education to measure influence on (1) HIV transmission and prevention knowledge and attitudes and (2) HIV-related sexual behaviors among youth. Religiously affiliated males were more likely than non-religious males to know when a condom should be used, respond correctly to HIV transmission questions and respond with less stigma to HIV-related scenarios. Increased levels of education among males corresponded significantly to increased knowledge of condom usage and HIV prevention strategies and less likelihood to respond with stigma. Only education levels influenced young female responses. Religious affiliation and education had minimal effects on sexual activity, condom usage, and multiple partnerships. African Independent Church/Zionist males were 1.6 times more likely to be sexually inexperienced than non-religious males but were also significantly less likely to use condoms (0.23, p=0.024). Non-religious youth were most likely to have visited sex workers and did not use condoms. These results suggest that religious affiliation, possibly as the result of educational opportunities afforded by religious-affiliated schools, is contributing to increased HIV transmission and prevention knowledge among youth in rural Central Mozambique but not influencing HIV-related sexual behavior. The need exists to strengthen the capacity of religious congregations to teach about HIV/AIDS and target non-religious youth with HIV transmission and prevention information.},

One demographic factor is the succession of generations; the percentage of adults who had been raised with no religion in-creased from 2 percent to 6 percent. Delayed marriage and parenthood also contrib-uted to the increase. Religious skepticism proved to be an unlikely explanation: Most people with no preference hold conventional religious beliefs, despite their alien-ation from organized religion. In fact, these ``unchurched believers '' made up most of the increase in the ``no religion '' preferences. Politics, too, was a significant factor. The increase in ``no religion '' responses was confined to political moderates and liberals; the religious preferences of political conservatives did not change. This political part of the increase in ``nones '' can be viewed as a symbolic statement against the Religious Right. the 1990s were a time when religion was as-},

RESULTS: Our results indicated that patients living with HIV in the rural region of the Democratic Republic of Congo are in a constant state of tension between the messages for compliance to antiretroviral treatment advocated by caregivers, and those broadcasted by audiovisual media, religious leaders and local beliefs. This dissonance constitutes a real barrier to therapeutic compliance. CONCLUSION: Collaborative strategies between healthcare providers, patients, as well as religious, media and traditional organizations are urgently needed.},

In addition, it is widely used in determining public health policies.The BMI has been useful in population-based studies by virtue of its wide acceptance in defining specific categories of body mass as a health issue. However, it is increasingly clear that BMI is a rather poor indicator of percent of body fat. Importantly, the BMI also does not capture information on the mass of fat in different body sites. The latter is related not only to untoward health issues but to social issues as well. Lastly, current evidence indicates there is a wide range of BMIs over which mortality risk is modest, and this is age related. All of these issues are discussed in this brief review.},

Participants' interest in and intention to work with churches, as well as their comfort level discussing sexual health-related topics with religious congregations, was high. Four themes emerged to highlight the different perspectives of service providers' recommendations for addressing challenges and strengthening partnerships with churches to deliver HIV services including: (1) carefully selecting churches and HIV services to provide, (2) gaining ``buy-in'' and support of church leadership, (3) taking advantage of conflict with church doctrine, and (4) choosing appropriate delivery strategies. Study findings demonstrate that although challenges exist, heath service providers in this region of the United States may be interested in addressing HIV among faith communities. Study findings also provide concrete solutions to previously documented barriers to HIV prevention in Black Churches. Such information will benefit researchers and practitioners seeking to expand effective HIV prevention efforts with Black Churches in communities who bear a disproportionate burden of HIV infections.},

The advantage of these estimates is that they are unbiased estimates of, for example, the deviations of age, period, and cohort effects from their linear trends, or changes in the linear trends of cohort effects within cohorts, or the residuals of fixed effect APCMC models. If the fixed effect APCMC model contains the relevant variables (is well specified), these estimable functions are unbiased estimates of functions of the parameters that generated the dependent variable data, even though the parameters that generated that data are not identified. I provide a simplified approach to establishing which functions are estimable in fixed effect APCMC models that provides an intuitive understanding of estimable functions by showing clearly and simply why they are estimable. This approach involves the partitioning of the age, period, and cohort effects into linear components and deviations from the linear components; the use of the ``line of solutions''; and of the ``extended null vector.''},

Latent class analysis reveals three groups based on knowledge and attitudes about science, religiosity, and preferences for certain religious interpretations of the world. The traditional perspective (43 percent) is marked by a preference for religion compared to science; the modern perspective (36 percent) holds the opposite view. A third perspective, which we call post-secular (21 percent), views both science and religion favorably. However, when faced with competing accounts of events such as creation and evolution, post-seculars root their views in religion rather than in mainstream science. Regression models indicate that perspectives on science and religion do not simply mirror other denominational or ideological differences. Furthermore, religio-scientific perspectives shape attitudes about political issues where scientific and some religious communities diverge, including on abortion rights and stem cell research. Overall, most individuals favor either scientific or religious ways of understanding, but many scientifically inclined individuals prefer certain religious accounts. This suggests that public divisions related to science and religion are cultural and epistemological. This article underscores the complexity of the boundary between reason and faith and highlights the roots of political conflict in perspectives on science and religion in the United States.},

Method Fifty-two 12- to 17-year-old, war-affected girls exposed to rape and inappropriate sexual touch in the Democratic Republic of Congo were screened for trauma, depression and anxiety, conduct problems, and prosocial behavior. They were then randomized to a 15 session, group-based, culturally modified TF-CBT (n = 24) group or a wait-list control group (n = 28). Primary analysis, by intention-to-treat, involving all randomly assigned participants occurred at pre- and postintervention and at 3-month follow-up (intervention group only). Results Compared to the wait list control, the TF-CBT group experienced significantly greater reductions in trauma symptoms (F1,49 = 52.708, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001, {$\chi$}p2 = 0.518). In addition, the TF-CBT group showed a highly significant improvement in symptoms of depression and anxiety, conduct problems, and prosocial behavior. At 3-months follow-up the effect size (Cohen's d) for the TF-CBT group was 2.04 (trauma symptoms), 2.45 (depression and anxiety), 0.95 (conduct problems), and-1.57 (prosocial behavior). Conclusions A group-based, culturally modified, TF-CBT intervention delivered by nonclinically trained Congolese facilitators resulted in a large, statistically significant reduction in posttraumatic stress symptoms and psychosocial difficulties among war-affected girls exposed to rape or sexual violence.

Prospective prediction of long-term prognosis in pediatric and adolescent clinical settings is difficult. Improved prognosis prediction would support wise allocation of limited treatment resources. The purpose of this article is to evaluate whether family history of psychiatric disorder can statically predict long-term prognosis among conduct-problem children. Method Participants were male members of the Dunedin Study, a birth cohort of 1,037 children (52\% male). Conduct-problem subtypes were defined using prospective assessments between ages 7 and 26 years. Family history interviews assessed mental disorders for three generations: the participants' grandparents, parents, and siblings. Results Family history of externalizing disorders distinguished life-course persistent antisocial males from other conduct-problem children and added significant incremental validity beyond family and child risk factors. A simple three-item family history screen of maternal-reported alcohol abuse was associated with life-course persistent prognosis in our research setting and should be evaluated in clinical practice. Conclusions Family history of externalizing disorders distinguished between life-course persistent versus childhood-limited and adolescent-onset conduct problems. Brief family history questions may assist clinicians in pediatric settings to refine the diagnosis of conduct disorder and identify children who most need treatment.},

The SMR for all causes of death was 082 (p{$<$}0001) and the SMR values for cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia and bronchitis, peptic ulcer, liver cirrhosis, cancer of the respiratory organs, and cancer of the lung were all significantly smaller than unity. Taking regional mortality differences into account, a similar computation was made dividing the cohort into two subcohorts-that is, the priests living in eastern Japan and those in western Japan. Both subcohorts showed a highly significantly smaller SMR than unity for all causes of death. With the exception of only a few causes of death for which the observed number of deaths was small, they also showed such reduced SMRs for nearly all of the causes of death tested. A questionnaire survey on the current life style of active priests showed that they smoke less, eat less meat and fish as they follow the more traditional Japanese dietary habits, and live in less polluted areas, but their drinking habits do not differ much from that of the average Japanese adult man. Possible reasons for their reduced mortality are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A significant body of research suggests that religious involvement is related to better mental and physical health. Religion or spirituality was identified as an important health protective factor by women participating in the East Side Village Health Worker Partnership (ESVHWP), a community-based participatory research initiative on Detroit's east side. However, relatively little research to date has examined the mechanisms through which religion may exert a positive effect on health. OBJECTIVE: The research presented here examines the direct effects of different forms of religious involvement on health, and the mediating effects of social support received in the church as a potential mechanism that may account for observed relationships between church attendance and health. DESIGN: This study involved a random sample household survey of 679 African-American women living on the east side of Detroit, conducted as part of the ESVHWP. MAIN RESULTS: Results of multivariate analyses show that respondents who pray less often report a greater number of depressive symptoms, and that faith, as an important source of strength in one's daily life, is positively associated with chronic conditions such as asthma or arthritis. Tests of the mediating effect of social support in the church indicated that social support received from church members mediates the positive relationship between church attendance and specific indicators of health. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that one of the major ways religious involvement benefits health is through expanding an individual's social connections. The implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.},

Supplement of brief questionnaires could improve the diagnostic accuracy of GPs for these common mental disorders. The aims of this study were to examine the usefulness of The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale (HADS) for GPs by: 1) Examining its psychometrics in the GPs' setting; 2) Testing its case-finding properties compared to patient-rated GAD and MDE (DSM-IV); and 3) Comparing its case finding abilities to that of the GPs using Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) rating. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey study 1,781 patients in three consecutive days in September 2001 attended 141 GPs geographically spread in Norway. Sensitivity, specificity, optimal cut off score, and Area under the curve (AUC) for the HADS and the CGI-S were calculated with Generalized Anxiety Questionnaire (GAS-Q) as reference standard for GAD, and Depression Screening Questionnaire (DSQ) for MDE. Results: The HADS-A had optimal cut off {$\geq$}8 (sensitivity 0.89, specificity 0.75), AUC 0.88 and 76\% of patients were correctly classified in relation to GAD. The HADS-D had by optimal cut off {$\geq$}8 (sensitivity 0.80 and specificity 0.88) AUC 0.93 and 87\% of the patients were correctly classified in relation to MDE. Proportions of the total correctly classified at the CGI-S optimal cut-off {$\geq$}3 were 83\% of patients for GAD and 81\% for MDE. Conclusion: The results indicate that addition of the patients' HADS scores to GPs' information could improve their diagnostic accuracy of GAD and MDE.},

  abstract = {Potential home buyers may initiate contact with a real estate agent by asking to see a particular advertised house. This paper asks whether an agent's response to such a request depends on the race of the buyer or on whether the house is located in an integrated neighborhood. Like previous research about the causes of housing discrimination, this paper uses data from fair housing audits, a matched-pair technique for comparing the treatment of equally qualified black and white home buyers. However, we shift the focus from differences in the treatment of paired buyers to agent decisions concerning an individual house. Using a sample of all houses seen during the 1989 national Housing Discrimination Study, we estimate a random-effect, multinomial logit model to explain a real estate agent's joint decisions concerning whether to show each house to a black auditor and to a white auditor. We find evidence that agents interpret an initial housing request as an indication of a customer's preferences, but also are more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an integrated suburban neighborhood (redlining). Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas (steering); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white. These three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon the belief that some types of transactions are relatively unlikely for black customers (statistical discrimination).},

  abstract = {Background and aims Smoking prevalence has been falling in England for more than 50 years, but remains a prevalent and major public health problem. This study used an age\textendash period\textendash cohort (APC) approach to measure lifecycle, historical and generational patterns of individual smoking behaviour. Design APC analysis of repeated cross-sectional smoking prevalence data obtained from three nationally representative surveys. Setting England (1972\textendash 2019). Participants Individuals aged 18\textendash 90 years. Measurements We studied relative odds of current smoking in relation to age in single years from 18 to 90, 24 groups of 2-year survey periods (1972\textendash 73 to 2018\textendash 19) and 20 groups of 5-year birth cohorts (1907\textendash 11 to 1997\textendash 2001). Age and period rates were studied for two groups of birth cohorts: those aged 18\textendash 25 years and those aged over 25 years. Findings Relative to age 18, the odds of current smoking increased with age until approximately age 25 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.41\textendash 1.56] and then decreased progressively to age 90 (OR = 0.06, 95\% CI = 0.04\textendash 0.08). They also decreased almost linearly with period relative to 1972\textendash 73 (for 2018\textendash 19: OR = 0.30, 95\% CI = 0.26\textendash 0.34) and with birth cohort relative to 1902\textendash 06, with the largest decreased observed for birth cohort 1992\textendash 96 (OR = 0.44, 95\% CI = 0.35\textendash 0.46) and 1997\textendash 2001 (OR = 0.35, 95\% CI = 0.74\textendash 0.88). Smoking declined in the 18\textendash 25 age group by an average of 7\% over successive 2-year periods and by an average of 5\% in those aged over 25. Conclusions Smoking in England appears to have declined over recent decades mainly as a result of reduced smoking uptake before age 25, and to a lesser extent to smoking cessation after age 25.},

  abstract = {As Ghana seeks to improve mental healthcare services delivery, there is a heightened discourse regarding the role religious groups can play in the process. Whilst there is a general admission that there can be collaborative framework with faith-based treatments toward a holistic delivery of mental healthcare, the anxieties concerning the unverifiable nature of their services and reported abuses of patients appears to hamper this collaboration. In an attempt to carefully delineate and bring to the fore the role of religious groups in mental health, 12 clergy from a specific Christian strand called the neo-prophetic Christian ministries (or churches) were interviewed. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, findings show that these clergy view mental illness as a spiritual problem rather than a biomedical one. The treatments they prescribe for mental illness fall within two major approaches: the hope induction approach and the prophetic deliverance approach. Assessment of cure of illness involves observation of restored orientation, self-care and community participation and perceived complete exorcism. We conclude that Christian groups are actively involved in mental healthcare delivery and that policy can focus on sanitizing and improving these services into mainstream mental healthcare services in Ghana.},

Methods Participants were recruited in three groups: WLM (n = 25, BMI 24.1 {$\pm$} 2.3 kg/m2; maintaining {$\geq$} 13.6-kg weight loss for {$\geq$} 1 year), NC (n = 27, BMI 23.0 {$\pm$} 2.0 kg/m2; similar to current BMI of WLM), and OC (n = 28, BMI 34.3 {$\pm$} 4.8 kg/m2; similar to pre\textendash weight loss BMI of WLM). TDEE was measured using the doubly labeled water method. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured using indirect calorimetry. PAEE was calculated as (TDEE - [0.1 \texttimes{} TDEE] - REE). Results PAEE in WLM (812 {$\pm$} 268 kcal/d, mean {$\pm$} SD) was significantly higher compared with that in both NC (621 {$\pm$} 285 kcal/d, P {$<$} 0.01) and OC (637 {$\pm$} 271 kcal/d, P = 0.02). As a result, TDEE in WLM (2,495 {$\pm$} 366 kcal/d) was higher compared with that in NC (2,195 {$\pm$} 521 kcal/d, P = 0.01) but was not significantly different from that in OC (2,573 {$\pm$} 391 kcal/d). Conclusions The high levels of PAEE and TDEE observed in individuals maintaining a substantial weight loss (-26.2 {$\pm$} 9.8 kg maintained for 9.0 {$\pm$} 10.2 years) suggest that this group relies on high levels of energy expended in physical activity to remain in energy balance (and avoid weight regain) at a reduced body weight.},

  abstract = {Alienation is among the most influential terms in Marxist theory, but also one of the most ambiguous and controversial. Unlike previous literature, which has tended to focus on Marx' early philosophical writings, this offers a novel reinterpretation of the theory of alienation found in Marx's later works. Rather than conceiving alienation as a subjective experience or an inherent feature of social organization, I contend that alienation in the Marxist sense can be understood as an objective process arising from the appropriation of the results of production and their transformation into capital. This interpretation resolves the main theoretical problems conventionally associated with alienation theory, for example the tendency towards essentialism and moral paternalism. In particular, a Marxist theory of alienation explains the paradox of social power and isolation that characterizes contemporary capitalist societies, in which feelings of powerlessness and loneliness are intensified despite objective increases in humanity's social power and interdependence.},

One-step ahead forecasts document the utility of the proposed spatial\textendash temporal model. In addition, the manuscript illustrates techniques for rapidly computing the estimates based upon an interesting decomposition for modeling spatial and temporal effects. The decomposition maximizes the use of sparsity in some of the matrices and consequently accelerates computations.

  abstract = {Background: How parent and sibling obesity status comparatively shape a child's obesity is unknown. Purpose: To investigate how the obesity status of different children within the same family is related to a parent or sibling's obesity. Methods: A national sample of adults in 10,244 American households was surveyed during 2011; data were analyzed in 2012\textendash 2013. Of these households, 1,948 adults had one or two children; provided sociodemographic information; and reported on adult and child height and weight, physical activity, and food environment. Logistic regression models were estimated in which the outcome of interest was child obesity status, with parent and sibling obesity as key predictors, adjusting for a range of both adult and child social and demographic confounders. Results: In one-child households, it was 2.2 times more likely (SE{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.5) that the child would be obese if a parent was obese. In households with two children, having an obese younger sibling was more strongly associated with elder-child obesity (OR{$\frac{1}{4}$}5.4, SE{$\frac{1}{4}$}1.9) than parent's obesity status (OR{$\frac{1}{4}$}2.3, SE{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.8). Having an obese elder sibling was associated with younger-child obesity (OR{$\frac{1}{4}$}5.6, SE{$\frac{1}{4}$}1.9), and parent obesity status was no longer significant. Within-family sibling obesity was more strongly patterned between siblings of the same gender than between different genders, and child physical activity was significantly associated with obesity status. Conclusions: Considering offspring composition and sibling gender may be beneficial in childhood obesity prevention and intervention.

In this article, we explore the religious ``Dones''\textemdash those who have disaffiliated with their religious congregations but, unlike the Nones, continue to associate with a religious tradition. Drawing on a unique dataset of 100 in-depth interviews with self-identified Christians, we explain the ``push'' and ``pull'' factors that lead a person to intentionally leave their congregations. We find that a bureaucratic structure and a narrow focus on certain moral proscriptions can drive people away, while the prospect of forming more meaningful relationships and the opportunities to actively participate in social justice issues draw people out. From these factors, we show that an ``iron cage of congregations'' exists that is ill-suited to respond to a world where religious life is increasingly permeable as people enact their spirituality outside traditional religious organizations. We conclude by questioning whether the spiritual lives of the Dones are ultimately sustainable without institutional support.},

Using several analytic approaches, we find that estimates of network size found in the 2004 and 2010 General Social Surveys (GSS), as well as other representative samples, were affected by significant interviewer effects. Across these surveys, we find a negative correlation between interviewer effects and mean network size. In the 2004 GSS, levels of social connectivity are strongly linked to interviewer-level variation and reflect the fact that some interviewers obtained highly improbable levels of social isolation. In the 2010 GSS, we observe larger interviewer effects in two versions of the questionnaire in which training and fatigue effects among interviewers were more likely. Results support the argument that many estimates of social connectivity are biased by interviewer effects. Some interviewers' failure to elicit network data makes inferences, such as the argument that networks have become smaller, an artifact. Overall, this study highlights the importance of interviewer effects for network data collection and raises questions about other survey items with similar issues.},

These mechanisms have special theoretical importance because disparities in health behaviors, unlike disparities in many other components of health, involve something more than the ability to use income to purchase good health. Based on a review of broad literatures in sociology, economics, and public health, we classify explanations of higher smoking, lower exercise, poorer diet, and excess weight among low-SES persons into nine broad groups that specify related but conceptually distinct mechanisms. The lack of clear support for any one explanation suggests that the literature on SES disparities in health and health behaviors can do more to design studies that better test for the importance of the varied mechanisms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVEdEpidemiological studies have repeatedly investigated the association between depression and metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the results have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current evidence from cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies that evaluated this association. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdMEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles published up to January 2012. Cross-sectional and cohort studies that reported an association between the two conditions in adults were included. Data on prevalence, incidence, unadjusted or adjusted odds ratio (OR), and 95\% CI were extracted or provided by the authors. The pooled OR was calculated separately for cross-sectional and cohort studies using random-effects models. The I2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. RESULTSdThe search yielded 29 cross-sectional studies (n = 155,333): 27 studies reported unadjusted OR with a pooled estimate of 1.42 (95\% CI 1.28\textendash 1.57; I2 = 55.1\%); 11 studies reported adjusted OR with depression as the outcome (1.27 [1.07\textendash 1.57]; I2 = 60.9\%), and 12 studies reported adjusted OR with MetS as the outcome (1.34 [1.18\textendash 1.51]; I2 = 0\%). Eleven cohort studies were found (2 studies reported both directions): 9 studies (n = 26,936 with 2,316 new-onset depression case subjects) reported adjusted OR with depression as the outcome (1.49 [1.19\textendash 1.87]; I2 = 56.8\%), 4 studies (n = 3,834 with 350 MetS case subjects) reported adjusted OR with MetS as the outcome (1.52 [1.20\textendash 1.91]; I2 = 0\%). CONCLUSIONSdOur results indicate a bidirectional association between depression and MetS. These results support early detection and management of depression among patients with MetS and vice versa.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between changes in red meat consumption during a 4-year period and subsequent 4-year risk of T2DM in US adults. DESIGN AND SETTING Three prospective cohort studies in US men and women. PARTICIPANTS We followed up 26 357 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2006), 48 709 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2006), and 74 077 women in the Nurses' Health Study II (1991-2007). Diet was assessed by validated food frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 years. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios with adjustment for age, family history, race, marital status, initial red meat consumption, smoking status, and initial and changes in other lifestyle factors (physical activity, alcohol intake, total energy intake, and diet quality). Results across cohorts were pooled by an inverse variance\textendash weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident T2DM cases validated by supplementary questionnaires. RESULTS During 1 965 824 person-years of follow-up, we documented 7540 incident T2DM cases. In the multivariate-adjusted models, increasing red meat intake during a 4-year interval was associated with an elevated risk of T2DM during the subsequent 4 years in each cohort (all P {$<$} .001 for trend). Compared with the reference group of no change in red meat intake, increasing red meat intake of more than 0.50 servings per day was associated with a 48\% (pooled hazard ratio, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.37-1.59) elevated risk in the subsequent 4-year period, and the association was modestly attenuated after further adjustment for initial body mass index and concurrent weight gain (1.30; 95\% CI, 1.21-1.41). Reducing red meat consumption by more than 0.50 servings per day from baseline to the first 4 years of follow-up was associated with a 14\% (pooled hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.93) lower risk during the subsequent entire follow-up through 2006 or 2007. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increasing red meat consumption over time is associated with an elevated subsequent risk of T2DM, and the association is partly mediated by body weight. Our results add further evidence that limiting red meat consumption over time confers benefits for T2DM prevention.},

  abstract = {Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies assessing the association between depression and risk of developing stroke in adults. Data Sources A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases (to May 2011) was supplemented by manual searches of bibliographies of key retrieved articles and relevant reviews. Study Selection We included prospective cohort studies that reported risk estimates of stroke morbidity or mortality by baseline or updated depression status assessed by self-reported scales or clinician diagnosis. Data Extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data on depression status at baseline, risk estimates of stroke, study quality, and methods used to assess depression and stroke. Hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled using fixed-effect or random-effects models when appropriate. Associations were tested in subgroups representing different participant and study characteristics. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plots and Begg test. Results The search yielded 28 prospective cohort studies (comprising 317 540 participants) that reported 8478 stroke cases (morbidity and mortality) during a follow-up period ranging from 2 to 29 years. The pooled adjusted HRs were 1.45 (95\% CI, 1.29-1.63; P for heterogeneity Ͻ.001; random-effects model) for total stroke, 1.55 (95\% CI, 1.25-1.93; P for heterogeneity=.31; fixed-effects model) for fatal stroke (8 studies), and 1.25 (95\% CI, 1.11-1.40; P for heterogeneity=.34; fixed-effects model) for ischemic stroke (6 studies). The estimated absolute risk differences associated with depression were 106 cases for total stroke, 53 cases for ischemic stroke, and 22 cases for fatal stroke per 100 000 individuals per year. The increased risk of total stroke associated with depression was consistent across most subgroups.

  abstract = {Objectives. We explored the relationship between social isolation and mortality in a nationally representative US sample and compared the predictive power of social isolation with that of traditional clinical risk factors. Methods. We used data on 16 849 adults from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Death Index. Predictor variables were 4 social isolation factors and a composite index. Comparison predictors included smoking, obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Unadjusted Kaplan\textendash Meier tables and Cox proportional hazards regression models controlling for sociodemographic characteristics were used to predict mortality. Results. Socially isolated men and women had worse unadjusted survival curves than less socially isolated individuals. Cox models revealed that social isolation predicted mortality for both genders, as did smoking and high blood pressure. Among men, individual social predictors included being unmarried, participating infrequently in religious activities, and lacking club or organization affiliations; among women, significant predictors were being unmarried, infrequent social contact, and participating infrequently in religious activities. Conclusions. The strength of social isolation as a predictor of mortality is similar to that of well-documented clinical risk factors. Our results suggest the importance of assessing patients' level of social isolation. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:2056\textendash 2062. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2013.301261)},

  abstract = {Objective: Specific genetic or biological markers may predict inadequate response to therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD). The objective of the current post hoc analysis was to evaluate the effect of specific biological and genetic markers on the antidepressant efficacy of adjunctive l-methylfolate 15 mg versus placebo from a trial of inadequate responders to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Method: The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial used the sequential parallel comparison design. Outpatients with SSRI-resistant MDD (DSM-IV criteria) received l-methylfolate 15 mg/d for 60 days, placebo for 30 days followed by l-methylfolate 15 mg/d for 30 days, or placebo for 60 days. The effects of baseline levels of select biological and genetic markers individually and combined on treatment response to l-methylfolate versus placebo were evaluated; the primary response measure was the 28-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-28). The first patient was enrolled July 14, 2009, and the last patient completed April 28, 2011. Results: Seventy-five patients were enrolled. Patients with specific biological (body mass index {$\geq$}\,30 kg/m2, elevated plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or 4-hydroxy-2nonenal, low S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio) and genetic markers at baseline had significantly (P\,{$\leq$}\,.05) greater pooled mean change from baseline on the HDRS-28 with l-methylfolate versus placebo. Pooled mean change from baseline on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale was significantly (P\,{$<$}\,.05) greater with l-methylfolate versus placebo for most genetic markers. Most combinations of baseline biological and genetic markers predicted significantly (P\,{$\leq$}\,.05) greater reductions in pooled mean change from baseline in HDRS-28 scores with l-methylfolate versus placebo. Conclusions: Biomarkers associated with inflammation or metabolism and genomic markers associated with l-methylfolate synthesis and metabolism may identify patients with SSRIresistant depression who are responsive to adjunctive therapy with l-methylfolate 15 mg. Confirmatory studies are needed.

Scales were developed to measure these problem-solving styles and were administered to 197 church members. These three styles were clearly identifiable through factor analysis. Further, as predicted, the three styles of problem-solving related differently to measures of religiousness and competence. The report of a problem-solving style involving active personal exchange with God (Collaborative) appears to be part of an internalized committed form of religion, one holding positive implications for the competence of the individual. A problem-solving style in which the individual waits for solutions from God (Deferring) seems to be part of an externally-oriented religion providing answers to questions the individual is less able to resolve. This style was associated with lower levels of competence. A Self-Directing style emphasizes the freedom God gives people to direct their own lives. This approach appears to be an active coping orientation which stresses personal agency, involves lower levels of traditional religious involvement, and is part of a generally effective style of functioning. This study points to the important diverse roles religion plays in the problem-solving process.},

Although academic interest in isolation is long-standing, recent years have seen an explosion of research on the topic. We explore the connection between this explosion and new social media and highlight a division within the literature between researchers who see new social media as creating more feelings of isolation and others who think that the jury is still out.

  abstract = {MAP workshops use a human rights framework to enable men to recognize the ways in which contemporary gender roles mirror the oppressive relations of power characteristic of apartheid. This oppression has devastating health consequences for women, placing them at risk for violence, limiting their ability to negotiate the terms and conditions of sex, and severely compromising their sexual and reproductive health, including increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and placing the burden of care and support for people living with AIDS squarely on women's shoulders. In the service of promoting gender equality and protecting women from HIV/AIDS, MAP draws the connections between sexism and racism and other forms of oppression and strives to get men to see the ways in which gender equality is a fundamental human right of comparable importance to those fought for during the anti-apartheid years. This approach connects gender equality to South Africa's rich tradition of social justice activism and situates it squarely within human rights discourses and traditions embraced by most South African men. Many MAP educators come from activist backgrounds and apply their expertise to devising strategies that get men to take a proactive stand for gender equality and against women's oppression. MAP activist Dumisani Rebombo put it this way: First, contemporary gender roles can compromise men's health by encouraging men to equate a range of risky behaviors -- violence, alcohol and substance use, the pursuit of multiple sexual partners, the domination of women -- with being manly, while simultaneously encouraging men to view health-seeking behaviors as a sign of weakness. A number of studies demonstrate clearly that such gender roles leave men especially vulnerable to HIV infection, decrease the likelihood that they will seek HIV testing, and increase the likelihood of contributing to actions and situations that could spread the virus. Noar and Morokoff (2001) documented the effects of "masculinity ideology" on condom usage and sexual and reproductive health in general and indicate that traditional men's gender roles lead to "more negative condom attitudes and less consistent condom use" and promote "beliefs that sexual relationships are adversarial." Similarly, a recent study of antiretrovirals treatment in Johannesburg conducted between April and June of 2004 reported that women accessing ARVs "outnumbered men by a ration of 2 to 1" (Hudspeth, Venter, Van Rie, Wing, \& Feldman, 2004). This same study reported that women's CD4 count at initiation of treatment was also significantly higher than men's (100 cells/\textmu l in women and 85 cells/\textmu l in men) and concluded by saying, "The observation that two-thirds of patients were female, with 23\% of women referred from prevention of mother to child transmission programmes, underscores the need for programmes that target HIV-infected men" (Personal Correspondence, 2004). These findings were similar to those reported in a study of VCT uptake in the Khayelitsha clinic outside Cape Town, South Africa, where fully 70 percent were women (Coetzee et al., 2004). The workshops are carried out by a cadre of well-trained MAP educators from an extensive network of partner NGOs, CBOs, and governmental organizations. All MAP educators are required to undergo an intensive training process. The importance of adequate training for MAP educators cannot be understated. In order to facilitate MAP workshops effectively, educators must be well prepared to challenge harmful attitudes that condone violence and the oppression of women. Without substantial training an educator runs the risk of facilitating a workshop that could further perpetuate harmful attitudes and beliefs. Therefore, educators begin their training by experiencing a MAP workshop as participants. This allows educators an opportunity to adequately explore and reexamine their own personal values about gender and health. After the initial workshop, educators are required to carry out "teach-backs," in which they facilitate a MAP workshop in a community setting. The teach-backs provide an opportunity for new educators to receive substantial feedback from their peers and MAP master trainers. Once trained, MAP educators continue to receive ongoing technical assistance through additional trainings offered by members of the Men as Partners Network.},

In contrast, when viewing negative pictures, participants could regulate heart rate only when feedback was real. Ratings of task success paralleled heart rate.

  abstract = {This paper reviews the methods used for editing of the R\textendash R interval time series and how this editing can influence the results of heart rate (HR) variability analyses. Measurement of HR variability from short and long-term electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings is a non-invasive method for evaluating cardiac autonomic regulation. HR variability provides information about the sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic balance. One important clinical application is the measurement of HR variability in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction. However, HR variability signals extracted from R\textendash R interval time series from ambulatory ECG recordings often contain different amounts of artifact. These false beats can be either of physiological or technical origin. For instance, technical artifact may result from poorly fastened electrodes or be due to motion of the subject. Ectopic beats and atrial fibrillation are examples of physiological artifact. Since ectopic and other false beats are common in the R\textendash R interval time series, they complicate the reliable analysis of HR variability sometimes making it impossible. In conjunction with the increased usage of HR variability analyses, several studies have confirmed the need for different approaches for handling false beats present in the R\textendash R interval time series. The editing process for the R\textendash R interval time series has become an integral part of these analyses. However, the published literature does not contain detailed reviews of editing methods and their impact on HR variability analyses. Several different editing and HR variability signal pre-processing methods have been introduced and tested for the artifact correction. There are several approaches available, i.e., use of methods involving deletion, interpolation or filtering systems. However, these editing methods can have different effects on HR variability measures. The effects of editing are dependent on the study setting, editing method, parameters used to assess HR variability, type of study population, and the length of R\textendash R interval time series. The purpose of this paper is to summarize these pre-processing methods for HR variability signal, focusing especially on the editing of the R\textendash R interval time series.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the applicability of four different measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in the assessment of cardiac vagal outflow, with special reference to the effect of breathing pattern. The anticholinergic effects of an intravenous glycopyrrolate infusion (5 {$\mu$}g kg-1 h-1 for 2 h) during spontaneous and controlled (15 min-1) breathing rate were investigated in eight volunteers, and the effects of different fixed breathing rates (6\textendash 15\textendash 24 min\textendash 1) and hyperventilation in 12 subjects. Cardiac vagal activity was assessed by ECG recordings in which the following measures of HRV were computed: the high-frequency (HF) spectral component, the instantaneous RR interval (RRI) variability (SD1) analysed from the Poincar\'e plots, the percentage of differences between successive RRIs greater than 50 ms (pNN50), and the square root of the mean squared differences of successive RRIs (RMSSD). On average, glycopyrrolate reduced the HF spectral component by 99{$\cdot$}8\%, SD1 by 91{$\cdot$}3\%, pNN50 by 100\% and RMSSD by 97{$\cdot$}0\%. The change of breathing pattern from controlled to spontaneous decreased significantly the HF component and pNN50, but did not affect SD1 or RMSSD. Rapid breathing rate (24 min\textendash 1) decreased the HF component, but had no effects on the other measures. A controlled breathing rate is needed for a reliable assessment of cardiac vagal outflow by the spectral analysis technique. The quantitative geometrical analysis of short-term RRI variability from the Poincar\'e plots and the time domain measure RMSSD were not significantly affected by changes in the breathing rate, suggesting that these indices are more suitable for the measurement of cardiac vagal outflow during the `free-running' ambulatory conditions.},

There are few reliable data, however, that can trace out national-level trends of bivocational clergy. Using the Current Population Survey, this study tests whether there has been any proportional increase in bivocational clergy and to what extent such an increase has been localized to certain groups. We find that the percentage of clergy who report having a second job has not increased since 1996. However, clergy who are female, unmarried, or working in the American northeast are increasingly likely to report working a second job. These trends suggest that clergy who receive occupational advantages\textemdash due to gender or marital status\textemdash or who live in highly religious/low cost-of-living regions of the country may be protected from taking on a second job whereas those clergy without these advantages increasingly must depend on additional sources of income.},

Further articles were identified through cross-referencing, discussion with colleagues and hand-searching key journals. One mixed, 10 qualitative and four quantitative studies were reviewed. Results Some studies claim that arts-based interventions are effective in altering attitudes, but poor descriptions of methodology and results make it difficult to judge these claims. No studies consider the effects on behaviour. The evidence base for using arts-based interventions to foster diagnostic observation skills is stronger. However, their effect on other clinical skills has not been studied. Conclusions There is a need for further studies to produce a rigorous evaluation of arts-based interventions in terms of their effects on attitudes, behaviour and technical skills other than those involved in observation.},

  abstract = {In response to health problems, individuals may strategically activate their social network ties to help manage crisis and uncertainty. While it is well-established that social relationships provide a crucial safety net, little is known about who is chosen to help during an episode of illness. Guided by the Network Episode Model, two aspects of consulting others in the face of mental illness are considered. First, we ask who activates ties, and what kinds of ties and networks they attempt to leverage for discussing health matters. Second, we ask about the utility of activating health-focused network ties. Specifically, we examine the consequences of network activation at time of entry into treatment for individuals' quality of life, social satisfaction, ability to perform social roles, and mental health functioning nearly one year later. Using interview data from the longitudinal Indianapolis Network Mental Health Study (INMHS, N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 171), we focus on a sample of new patients with serious mental illness and a group with less severe disorders who are experiencing their first contact with the mental health treatment system. Three findings stand out. First, our results reveal the nature of agency in illness response. Whether under a rational choice or habitus logic, individuals appear to evaluate support needs, identifying the best possible matches among a larger group of potential health discussants. These include members of the core network and those with prior mental health experiences. Second, selective activation processes have implications for recovery. Those who secure adequate network resources report better outcomes than those who injudiciously activate network ties. Individuals who activate weaker relationships and those who are unsupportive of medical care experience poorer functioning, limited success in fulfilling social roles, and lower social satisfaction and quality of life later on. Third, the evidence suggests that social networks matter above and beyond the influence of any particular individual or relationship. People whose networks can be characterized as having a pro-medical culture report better recovery outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objectives. We sought to provide data-based estimates of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and describe risk factors for such violence. Methods. We used nationally representative household survey data from 3436 women selected to answer the domestic violence module who took part in the 2007 DRC Demographic and Health Survey along with population estimates to estimate levels of sexual violence. We used multivariate logistic regression to analyze correlates of sexual violence. Results. Approximately 1.69 to 1.80 million women reported having been raped in their lifetime (with 407397\textendash 433785 women reporting having been raped in the preceding 12 months), and approximately 3.07 to 3.37 million women reported experiencing intimate partner sexual violence. Reports of sexual violence were largely independent of individual-level background factors. However, compared with women in Kinshasa, women in Nord-Kivu were significantly more likely to report all types of sexual violence. Conclusions. Not only is sexual violence more generalized than previously thought, but our findings suggest that future policies and programs should focus on abuse within families and eliminate the acceptance of and impunity surrounding sexual violence nationwide while also maintaining and enhancing efforts to stop militias from perpetrating rape.},

We examined the association between meeting, not meeting, or change in status of meeting physical activity guidelines through walking and the 5-year incidence of metabolic syndrome in older adults. Methods: A total of 1,863 Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study participants aged 70\textendash 79 were followed for 5 years (1997\textendash 1998 to 2002\textendash 2003). Four walking groups were created based on self-report during years 1 and 6: Sustained low (Year 1, {$<$}150 min/week, and year 6, {$<$}150 min/week), decreased (year 1, {$>$}150 min/week, and year 6, {$<$}150 min/week), increased (year 1, {$<$}150 min/week, and year 6, {$>$}150 min/week), and sustained high (year 1, {$>$}150 min/week, and year 6, {$>$}150 min/week). Based on the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) panel guidelines, the metabolic syndrome criterion was having three of five factors: Large waist circumference, elevated blood pressure, triglycerides, blood glucose, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Results: Compared to the sustained low group, the sustained high group had a 39\% reduction in odds of incident metabolic syndrome [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.61; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.40\textendash 0.93], and a significantly lower likelihood of developing the number of metabolic syndrome risk factors that the sustained low group developed over 5 years ({$\beta$} = -0.16, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Meeting or exceeding the physical activity guidelines via walking significantly reduced the odds of incident metabolic syndrome and onset of new metabolic syndrome components in older adults. This protective association was found only in individuals who sustained high levels of walking for physical activity.},

In this article, we explicate the theory, review key findings, discuss refinements and limits to the theory, and discuss implications for health policies that might reduce health inequalities.We advocate policies that encourage medical and other health-promoting advances while at the same time breaking or weakening the link between these advances and socioeconomic resources. This can be accomplished either by reducing disparities in socioeconomic resources themselves or by developing interventions that, by their nature, are more equally distributed across SES groups.},

Results Although artefactual determinants may enhance a female preponderance to some extent, gender differences in depressive disorders are genuine. At present, adverse experiences in childhood, depression and anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence, sociocultural roles with related adverse experiences, and psychological attributes related to vulnerability to life events and coping skills are likely to be involved. Genetic and biological factors and poor social support, however, have few or no effects in the emergence of gender differences.

Twelve participants shared their experiences during semistructured interviews that were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. Although the priests recognized existing resources of social support or professional help, they generally underused them due to various personal and cultural factors. Religious coping was perceived as an expected strategy to maintain emotional balance. Priests reported avoiding disclosing personal problems to lay people in an attempt to maintain a positive image of themselves and of the Church, and to comply with group norms. They only sought professional help with reluctance and as a last resort, associating it with self-stigma. This study alerts mental health professionals to specific challenges and needs experienced by diocesan priests, and common barriers to help seeking. Further research recommendations are also suggested.},

This article examines how gay Catholics manage conflicting areas between their sexual and religious selves. Eight Polish gays with a Catholic background, who identified themselves as strong believers, shared their experiences during semi-structured interviews that were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results showed that internalization of the principles taught by the Roman Catholic Church triggered a conflict when participants became aware of their homosexuality. They used a number of strategies to reconcile conflicting identities, including limiting their religious involvement, questioning interpretation of the doctrine, undermining priests' authority, trying to reject homosexual attraction, putting trust in God's plan, using professional help, and seeking acceptance from clergy. This study alerts mental health professionals to specific risk factors associated with experiencing a religious conflict, and offers guidelines for counseling and further research.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine whether depressive symptoms are concurrent with physical activity and to examine the direction of the relationship from 23 to 50 years of age. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants included members of the 1958 British Birth Cohort, a general population sample of all persons born in England, Scotland, and Wales in a single week in March 1958 who were followed up to 50 years of age (2008). We included approximately 11 000 cohort members with information on depressive symptoms or frequency of physical activity at 23, 33, 42, or 50 years of age. EXPOSURES Depressive symptoms were measured using the Psychological subscale of the Malaise Inventory; frequency of physical activity, by questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number of depressive symptoms (on a scale of 0 to 15 items), depression (defined as being in the top 10\% for symptoms at 23, 33, 42, or 50 years of age), and frequency of physical activity (times per week). RESULTS At most ages, we found a trend of fewer depressive symptoms with more frequent activity; for example, per higher frequency of activity per week at 50 years of age, the mean number of symptoms was lower by 0.06 (95\% CI, -0.09 to -0.04). In longitudinal analyses, activity was associated with fewer symptoms from 23 to 50 years of age (per higher frequency of activity per week, symptoms were lower by 0.06 [95\% CI, -0.07 to -0.05]), and the magnitude of association did not vary with age (P = .21 for interaction). Those who were inactive at 23 years of age and remained inactive 5 years later showed no change in symptom level (mean difference, -0.01 [95\% CI, -0.04 to 0.02]); those increasing activity to 3 times/wk had a lower mean number of symptoms (mean difference, -0.18 [95\% CI, -0.22 to -0.15]). Such differences equate to estimated reductions in odds of depression by 19\%. A longitudinal relationship observed between symptoms and activity weakened with age (P {$<$} .001 for interaction). Mean activity among those with no symptoms at 23 years of age and 5 years later was higher by 0.60 (95\% CI, 0.57-0.64) times/wk; in those with 1 additional depressive symptom, 0.53 (95\% CI, 0.49-0.56) times/wk. Activity frequency did not differ among those with no symptoms at 43 years of age who subsequently had 0 or 1 symptom at 48 years of age. Associations for depression were generally similar to those for the full symptom spectrum. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The relationship between activity and depressive symptoms was bidirectional, albeit more persistent during adult life in the direction from activity to depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that activity may alleviate depressive symptoms in the general population and, in turn, depressive symptoms in early adulthood may be a barrier to activity.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS \textemdash{} Three different datasets were used to test and validate the model. The Spanish and Mauritian studies included 207 men and 203 women and 1,411 men and 1,650 women, respectively. A third analytical dataset including 847 men was obtained from a previously published CFA of a U.S. population. The one-factor model included the metabolic syndrome core components (central obesity, insulin resistance, blood pressure, and lipid measurements). We also tested an expanded one-factor model that included uric acid and leptin levels. Finally, we used CFA to compare the goodness of fit of one-factor models with the fit of two previously published four-factor models. RESULTS \textemdash{} The simplest one-factor model showed the best goodness-of-fit indexes (comparative fit index 1, root mean-square error of approximation 0.00). Comparisons of one-factor with four-factor models in the three datasets favored the one-factor model structure. The selection of variables to represent the different metabolic syndrome components and model specification explained why previous exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, respectively, failed to identify a single factor for the metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} These analyses support the current clinical definition of the metabolic syndrome, as well as the existence of a single factor that links all of the core components.},

Objective: To evaluate the applicability of the Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) in international nursing research. Design: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional hospital nurse survey data from eight countries. Settings: Hospitals in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, New Zealand, Japan, Russia and Armenia. Participants: 54,738 direct care professional nurses from 646 hospitals in eight countries. Methods: Confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis were undertaken to identify the factor structure of the MBI. The internal consistencies of the subscales were investigated. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors being extracted from the 22-item Maslach burnout inventory. In nearly all countries the two items (6 and 16) related to the ``stress'' and ``strain'' involved in working with people loaded on the depersonalization subscale rather than the emotional exhaustion subscale to which they were initially assigned. The three subscales exhibited high reliability with Cronbach alphas exceeding the critical value of 0.70. The correlation coefficients for the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales were strong and positive. Conclusions: The 22-item Maslach burnout inventory has a similar factor structure and, with minor modifications, performed similarly across countries. The predictive validity of the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales might be improved by moving the two items related to stress and strain from the emotional exhaustion to the depersonalization subscale. Nevertheless, the MBI can be used with confidence as a burnout measure among nurses internationally to determine the effectiveness of burnout reduction measures generated by institutional and national policies.},

This novel approach can be applied to color video recordings of the human face and is based on automatic face tracking along with blind source separation of the color channels into independent components. Using Bland-Altman and correlation analysis, we compared the cardiac pulse rate extracted from videos recorded by a basic webcam to an FDA-approved finger blood volume pulse (BVP) sensor and achieved high accuracy and correlation even in the presence of movement artifacts. Furthermore, we applied this technique to perform heart rate measurements from three participants simultaneously. This is the first demonstration of a low-cost accurate video-based method for contact-free heart rate measurements that is automated, motion-tolerant and capable of performing concomitant measurements on more than one person at a time.},

Greater understanding of MetS developments may provide insight into targeted prevention strategies for individuals at greatest risk. The purpose of this study was to i) identify distinct patterns of longitudinal MetS development and; ii) develop a character profile that differentiates groups by level of MetS risk. Methods and Results: Data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n = 3 804; 18\textendash 30 y) was obtained by limited access application from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and used for this analysis. MetS, as defined by the Harmonized criteria, was assessed over a 20 year follow-up period. Group-level trajectory analysis identified 4 distinct groups with varying rates of component development [No (23.8\% of sample); Low (33.5\%); Moderate (35.3\%); and High MetS (7.4\%)]. After adjusting for covariates, individuals in the At-Risk groups (Low, Moderate and High MetS) were more likely to be of black ethnicity (1.37, 1.14\textendash 1.66), have a family history of cardiovascular disease (1.61, 1.31\textendash 1.97) and history of dieting (1.69, 1.20\textendash 2.39) when compared to the No Risk trajectory group (No MetS). Conversely, increasing baseline education (0.76, 0.65\textendash 0.89) and aerobic fitness (0.55, 0.47\textendash 0.64) was inversely associated with At-Risk group membership. Conclusions: Results suggest distinct profiles of MetS development that can be identified by baseline risk factors. Further research is necessary to understand the clinical implication of intermediate MetS development groups with respect to overall cardiometabolic risk.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the autonomic nervous system provides an organizing principle to interpret the adaptive significance of physiological responses in promoting social behavior. According to the polyvagal theory, the well-documented phylogenetic shift in neural regulation of the autonomic nervous system passes through three global stages, each with an associated behavioral strategy. The first stage is characterized by a primitive unmyelinated visceral vagus that fosters digestion and responds to threat by depressing metabolic activity. Behaviorally, the first stage is associated with immobilization behaviors. The second stage is characterized by the sympathetic nervous system that is capable of increasing metabolic output and inhibiting the visceral vagus to foster mobilization behaviors necessary for `fight or flight'. The third stage, unique to mammals, is characterized by a myelinated vagus that can rapidly regulate cardiac output to foster engagement and disengagement with the environment. The mammalian vagus is neuroanatomically linked to the cranial nerves that regulate social engagement via facial expression and vocalization. As the autonomic nervous system changed through the process of evolution, so did the interplay between the autonomic nervous system and the other physiological systems that respond to stress, including the cortex, the hypothalamic\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal axis, the neuropeptides of oxytocin and vasopressin, and the immune system. From this phylogenetic orientation, the polyvagal theory proposes a biological basis for social behavior and an intervention strategy to enhance positive social behavior.},

  abstract = {The scientific legacy of Paul MacLean provides important insights into the neural substrate of adaptive social behavior in mammals. Through his research and visionary conceptualizations, current investigators can legitimately study social behavior from a neurobiological perspective. His research and writings provided three important contributions. First, he emphasized the importance of evolution as an organizing principle that shaped both the structure of the nervous system and the adaptive social behavior. Second, by defining the limbic system, he legitimized the biological perspective in the study of emotion. Third, he recognized the important role of the vagal afferents in the regulation of higher brain structures. The paper will focus on the Polyvagal Theory. The Polyvagal Theory is a new conceptualization of the role of vagus and employs several features that MacLean emphasized including the importance of evolution, limbic structures and vagal afferents. The Polyvagal Theory builds on these early findings by MacLean and focuses on the link between phylogenetic changes in the autonomic nervous system and social behavior. By focusing on the phylogenetic changes in the structure of the vagus and the role that the vagus plays in the neural regulation of visceral state, new insights regarding social behavior emerge. Moreover, by articulating the phylogenetically organized hierarchy of neural circuits, insights into benefits of social behavior become evident as do an understanding of the behavioral and physiological features associated with stress and psychiatric disorders.},

After noting some of the distinctives of these traditions, we conclude with four strategies for navigating the unity and diversity of Christian spirituality in conceptualizing and measuring Christian formation.},

  abstract = {Training requirements for ordained clergy vary widely between US denominations, but the most common qualifications include the Master of Divinity (MDiv), a 3-year professional degree typically earned in residence full-time at a seminary or school of theology following completion of an undergraduate degree. However, past research has found that denominations with more limited formal training requirements for clergy tend to grow more rapidly and that professionalized clergy may actually contribute to denominational decline. I test this with Cox regression, comparing job lengths of Lutheran (ELCA) pastors with MDiv degrees and those who completed an alternative training program (TEEM) where older students complete less extensive coursework while simultaneously serving a ministry context. TEEM candidates often continue serving in this context upon being ordained. The key finding is a persistent advantage for TEEM program graduates net of demographic controls, regardless of how age and experience are factored in. The advantage is not the result of ongoing embeddedness in a single context, suggesting it may result from a combination of differences in the structure of formal education and the simultaneous contextual application. Both life experience (age) prior to being ordained and experience in ordained ministry also provide some advantage, but the effects are largely limited to MDiv graduates in their first few years of ministry. The results provide further evidence for the promise of alternative ministry preparation programs, and help elaborate previous theories of clergy religious capital.},

  abstract = {Background. Taxometric research on depression has yielded mixed results, with some studies supporting dimensional solutions and others supporting taxonic solutions. Although supplementary tests of construct validity might clarify these mixed findings, to date such analyses have not been reported. The present study represents a follow-up to our previous taxometric study of depression designed to evaluate the relative predictive validities of dimensional and categorical models of depression. Method. Two sets of dimensional and categorical models of depression were constructed from the depression items of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview : (1) empirically derived models obtained using latent structure analyses and (2) rationally selected models, including an additive depressive symptoms scale (dimensional) and DSM major depressive episodes (categorical). Both sets of dimensional and categorical models were compared in terms of their abilities to predict various clinically relevant outcomes (psychiatric diagnoses and impairment). Results. Factor analyses suggested a two-factor model (` cognitive\textendash affective ' and ` somatic ' symptoms) and latent class analyses suggested a three-class model (` severe depression ', ` moderate depression ' and ` cognitive\textendash affective distress '). In predictive analyses that simultaneously included dimensional and categorical models as predictors, the dimensional models remained significant unique predictors of outcomes while the categorical models did not. Conclusions. Both dimensional models provided superior predictive validity relative to their categorical counterparts. These results provide construct validity evidence for the dimensional findings from our previous taxometric study and thus inspire confidence in dimensional conceptualizations of depression. It remains for future research to evaluate the construct validity of the taxonic solutions reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Introduction: This study sought to determine the effect of a 2-year, multicomponent health intervention (Spirited Life) targeting metabolic syndrome and stress simultaneously. Design: An RCT using a three-cohort multiple baseline design was conducted in 2010\textendash 2014. Setting/participants: Participants were United Methodist clergy in North Carolina, U.S., in 2010, invited based on occupational status. Of invited 1,745 clergy, 1,114 consented, provided baseline data, and were randomly assigned to immediate intervention (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}395), 1-year waitlist (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}283), or 2-year waitlist (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}436) cohorts for a 48-month trial duration. Intervention: The 2-year intervention consisted of personal goal setting and encouragement to engage in monthly health coaching, an online weight loss intervention, a small grant, and three workshops delivering stress management and theological content supporting healthy behaviors. Participants were not blinded to intervention. Main outcome measures: Trial outcomes were metabolic syndrome (primary) and self-reported stress and depressive symptoms (secondary). Intervention effects were estimated in 2016 in an intention-to-treat framework using generalized estimating equations with adjustment for baseline level of the outcome and follow-up time points. Log-link Poisson generalized estimating equations with robust SEs was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for binary outcomes; mean differences were used for continuous/score outcomes. Results: Baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.9\% and depression was 11.4\%. The 12-month intervention effect showed a benefit for metabolic syndrome (PR{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.86, 95\% CI{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.79, 0.94, po0.001). This benefit was sustained at 24 months of intervention (PR{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.88; 95\% CI{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.78, 1.00, p{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.04). There was no significant effect on depression or stress scores. Conclusions: The Spirited Life intervention improved metabolic syndrome prevalence in a population of U.S. Christian clergy and sustained improvements during 24 months of intervention. These findings offer support for long-duration behavior change interventions and population-level interventions that allow participants to set their own health goals.},

  abstract = {Background Child well-being is associated with caregiver mental health. Research has focused on the absence or presence of mental health problems, such as depression, in caregivers. However, positive mental health \textendash{} defined as the presence of positive emotions, psychological functioning, and social functioning \textendash{} likely prevents depression and in caregivers may benefit children more than the mere absence of mental health problems. Little attention has been given to how caregivers sustain positive mental health, particularly when doing challenging work in impoverished settings. Objective The study's objective was to determine what successful caregivers of orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) in diverse countries do to sustain their positive mental health. Methods Using a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study design, trained local interviewers recruited a convenience sample of OVC caregivers through residential care institutions from five geographic regions (Kenya; Ethiopia; Cambodia; Hyderabad, India; and Nagaland, India). Participants completed surveys and in-depth interviews about strategies used to sustain their mental health over time or improve it during challenging times. Results Sixty-nine OVC caregivers from 28 residential care institutions participated. Positive mental health survey scores were high. We organized the strategies named into six categories ordered from most to least frequently named: Religious Practices; Engaging in Caregiving; Social Support; Pleasurable Activities; Emotion Regulation; and Removing Oneself from Work. Prayer and reading religious texts arose as common strategies. Participants reported promoting positive emotions by focusing on their work's meaning and playing with children. The similar findings across diverse regions were striking. Some differences included more emphasis on emotion control in Ethiopia; listening to music/singing in Kenya and Hyderabad; and involving children in the tasks the participants enjoyed less (e.g., cleaning) in Cambodia. Conclusions Under real-world conditions, small daily activities appeared to help sustain positive mental health. In addition, fostering structures that allow caregivers to engage regularly in rewarding caregiving tasks may be an affordable and scalable idea which could potentially benefit caregivers, children, and employers.},

Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to assess the variance in seven positive and negative affective outcomes explained by four sets of variables: social desirability, demographics, variables shown to relate to affect across populations, and clergy-specific variables. Social support, social isolation, and financial stress together explained between 8\% and 34\% of the variance in both positive and negative affect outcomes. The clergy-specific variables explained an additional 11\%-16\% of variance. Congregation demands and thoughts of leaving ministry were significantly related to both positive and negative affect. Spiritual well-being, positive congregations, congregation support of clergy, and confidence in supervisor consideration of future church appointments were significantly related to positive affect outcomes. These findings may be used to ameliorate negative affect and promote positive affect among clergy, and can be used as a guide to study affect in other caregiving populations.},

  abstract = {United Methodist clergy have been found to have higher than average selfreported rates of obesity, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and high blood pressure. However, health diagnoses differ from physical health functioning, which indicates how much health problems interfere with activities of daily living. Ninety-five percent (n = 1726) of all actively serving United Methodist clergy in North Carolina completed the SF-12, a measure of physical health functioning that has US norms based on self-administered survey data. Sixty-two percent (n = 1074) of our sample completed the SF-12 by selfadministered formats. We used mean difference tests among self-administered clergy surveys to compare the clergy SF-12 Physical Composite Scores to US-normed scores. Clergy reported significantly better physical health composite scores than their gender- and age-matched peers, despite above average disease burden in the same sample. Although health interventions tailored to clergy that address chronic disease are urgently needed, it may be difficult to elicit participation given pastors' optimistic view of their physical health functioning.},

Like any group united by similar beliefs and norms, clergy may find culturally tailored health programming more accessible and effective. There is an absence of research on what aspects clergy find important for clergy health programs. We conducted 11 focus groups with United Methodist Church pastors and district superintendents. Participants answered open-ended questions about clergy health program desires and ranked program priorities from a list of 13 possible programs. Pastors prioritized health club memberships, retreats, personal trainers, mental health counseling, and spiritual direction. District superintendents prioritized for pastors: physical exams, peer support groups, health coaching, retreats, health club memberships, and mental health counseling. District superintendents prioritized for themselves: physical exams, personal trainers, health coaching, retreats, and nutritionists. Additionally, through qualitative analysis, nine themes emerged concerning health and health programs: (1) clergy defined health holistically, and they expressed a desire for (2) schedule flexibility, (3) accessibility in rural areas, (4) low cost programs, (5) institutional support, (6) education on physical health, and (7) the opportunity to work on their health in connection with others. They also expressed concern about (8) mental health stigma and spoke about (9) the tension between prioritizing healthy behaviors and fulfilling vocational responsibilities. The design of future clergy health programming should consider these themes and the priorities clergy identified for health programming.},

  abstract = {Background: Adherence with medication regimens for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a life-saving behavior for people with HIV infection, yet adherence is challenging for many individuals with co-occurring substance use and/or mood disorders. Medication-taking selfefficacy, which is the confidence that one can take one's medication as prescribed, is associated with better adherence with HIV medication. However, little is known about the influence that other kinds of self-efficacy have on adherence with HIV medication, especially among HIV-infected individuals with co-occurring substance use and/or mood disorders. We sought to examine the relationship between adherence with HIV medication among substance users and three specific kinds of self-efficacy, ie, one's confidence that one can communicate with medical providers, get support, and manage one's mood. We further sought to examine whether symptoms of depression and anxiety moderate these relationships. Methods: Patients were recruited from three HIV clinics in the southeastern United States as part of an integrated study of treatment for HIV and substance use. Results: We interviewed 154 patients with HIV and substance use who reported taking HIV medications. Based on symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety, 63\% had probable depression and/or anxiety. Higher levels of self-efficacy in provider communication ({$\beta$} = 3.86, P , 0.01), getting needed support ({$\beta$} = 2.82, P , 0.01), and mood management ({$\beta$} = 2.29, P , 0.05) were related to better self-reported adherence with HIV medication among study participants with probable depression and/or anxiety. The three kinds of self-efficacy were not associated with medication adherence among participants with HIV and substance use only. Conclusion: In the search for mutable factors to improve medication adherence among individuals triply diagnosed with HIV, substance use, and mood disorders, these findings support previous research indicating the benefit of enhancing self-efficacy, and further point to three specific kinds of self-efficacy that may benefit medication adherence, ie, provider communication, getting support, and mood management.},

Health interventions are needed for clergy and may be tailored to their occupational context and theological beliefs. Few studies have sought to improve clergy health. No prior studies have utilized a randomized design. Spirited Life is a randomized, multiple baseline study that offered enrollment to nearly all United Methodist Church clergy in North Carolina in fall 2010. A total of 1114 clergy (response rate = 64\%) enrolled. Using a multiple baseline design, we randomized participants to three cohorts. Each cohort began the health intervention in one of three consecutive years. The third cohort served as a randomized waitlist control cohort, allowing comparisons between the first and third cohorts. The two-year Spirited Life intervention consists of: 1) a theological underpinning for health stewardship based on incarnation, grace, and response and delivered during workshops; 2) the stress management program Williams LifeSkills; 3) Naturally Slim, an online weight loss program; 4) phone contact with a Wellness Advocate; and 5) \$500 small grants for health goals. Metabolic syndrome is the primary endpoint. Stress and depressive severity are secondary endpoints. We measured each construct before, twice during, and at the end of the two-year intervention. Study outcomes, to be published after follow-up data are gathered, will provide evidence of the effectiveness of the combined intervention components of Spirited Life. If successful, the intervention may be considered for use with other clergy and faith populations.},

A total of 719 clergy received a wellness intervention, including a 10-week online weight-loss program in the first 12 months and monthly health coaching throughout 24 months. Mean changes in weight, blood pressure, high-density lipoproteins, and triglycerides were estimated using random effects linear models, accounting for repeated measures. Weight was additionally analyzed in subsamples stratified by body mass index (BMI). At baseline, 17.1\% of participants had BMI \&lt; 25 kg/m2 and 11.8\% had BMI {$\geq$} 40 kg/m2. Mean 12-month weight loss was -2.4 kg (95\% CI: -2.8 kg, -2.1 kg). On average, at 42 months, participants regained weight but did not exceed baseline (-0.5 kg, 95\% CI: -1.2 kg, 0.2 kg), improvements in triglycerides were completely sustained (-13.9 mg/dL, 95\% CI: -18.6 mg/dL, -9.2 mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure improvements remained significant (-1.9 mmHg, 95\% CI: -3.0 mmHg, -0.9 mmHg). Participants with a BMI {$\geq$} 40 kg/m2 lost significantly more weight that was sustained at 42 months (-5.8 kg, 95\% CI: -8.9 kg, -2.7 kg). The Spirited Life wellness intervention produced weight loss and, for participants with higher levels of obesity, sustained weight-loss maintenance. The intervention was effective for long-term prevention of weight gain among participants with BMI of 25 to {$\leq$}40 kg/m2, through 42 months. Wellness interventions such as Spirited Life should be considered for adoption.},

We integrate the fundamental cause theory, the gender relations theory, and the life course perspective to analyze gender differences in (a) the ways that early socioeconomic disadvantage launches bidirectional associations of body mass and SES and (b) the extent to which these mutually reinforcing effects generate socioeconomic disparities in midlife body mass. Using structural equation modeling, we find that socioeconomic disadvantage at age 18 is related to higher body mass index and a greater risk of obesity at age 54, and that this relationship is significantly stronger for women than men. Moreover, women are more adversely affected by two mechanisms underlying the focal association: the obesogenic effect of socioeconomic disadvantage and the SES-impeding effect of obesity. These patterns were also replicated in propensity score\textendash matching models. We conclude that gender and SES act synergistically over the life course to shape reciprocal chains of two disadvantaged statuses: heavier body mass and lower SES.},

In a study of 142 retail bank units in the United States, evidence is found for a relationship between the racial composition of an organization's workforce and diversity climate that is moderated by the racial composition of the community where the organization is located. The results suggest that when few racial minorities live in the community in which an organization is embedded, workforce diversity has an impact on employees' diversity climate perceptions. As racial minority popular share increases, workforce diversity tends to lose this signaling value.},

Results: In women, depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of the metabolic syndrome in adulthood (odds ratio for NCEP metabolic syndrome per 1 SD increase in depressive symptoms 1.40, 95\% confidence interval 1.05\textendash 1.85). The metabolic syndrome in childhood, in turn, predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms in adulthood ( p ϭ .03).

Missing outcome data are a problem for two reasons: (1) the loss of sample members can reduce the power to detect statistically significant differences, and (2) the introduction of non-random differences between the treatment and control groups can lead to bias in the estimate of the intervention's effect. The report reviews a selection of methods available for addressing missing data, and then examines their relative performance using extensive simulations that varied a typical educational RCT on three dimensions: (1) the amount of missing data; (2) the level at which data are missing-at the level of whole schools (the assumed unit of randomization) or for students within schools; and, (3) the underlying missing data mechanism.

With these, a patient's risk for obesity-related co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease can be estimated and appropriate treatment plans and goals established. Within the United States, prevalence rates for generalized obesity (BMI {$>$} 30 kg/m2), extreme obesity (BMI {$>$} 40 kg/m2), and central obesity are continuing to rise with peak obesity rates occurring in the 5th-7thdecades. Women have more generalized obesity but less central obesity than men, and obesity disproportionately affects US minorities. Of concern are increases in obesity rates in youth (ages 2-19 years) in the US as well as around the globe. This trend will likely continue to fuel the global obesity epidemic for decades to come, worsening population health, creating infrastructural challenges as countries attempt to meet the additional health-care demands, and greatly increasing health-care expenditures world-wide. Beyond individual weight management, societal and economic innovations will be necessary that focus on strategies to prevent further increases in overweight and obesity rates.

  abstract = {Measurement invariance assesses the psychometric equivalence of a construct across groups or across time. Measurement noninvariance suggests that a construct has a different structure or meaning to different groups or on different measurement occasions in the same group, and so the construct cannot be meaningfully tested or construed across groups or across time. Hence, prior to testing mean differences across groups or measurement occasions (e.g., boys and girls, pretest and posttest), or differential relations of the construct across groups, it is essential to assess the invariance of the construct. Conventions and reporting on measurement invariance are still in flux, and researchers are often left with limited understanding and inconsistent advice. Measurement invariance is tested and established in different steps. This report surveys the state of measurement invariance testing and reporting, and details the results of a literature review of studies that tested invariance. Most tests of measurement invariance include configural, metric, and scalar steps; a residual invariance step is reported for fewer tests. Alternative fit indices (AFIs) are reported as model fit criteria for the vast majority of tests; {$\chi$}2 is reported as the single index in a minority of invariance tests. Reporting AFIs is associated with higher levels of achieved invariance. Partial invariance is reported for about one-third of tests. In general, sample size, number of groups compared, and model size are unrelated to the level of invariance achieved. Implications for the future of measurement invariance testing, reporting, and best practices are discussed.},

Easy access to measuring HRV has led to a plethora of studies within emotion science and psychology assessing autonomic regulation, but significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV. Firstly, both breathing and blood pressure regulation have their own relationship to social, emotional, and cognitive experiments \textendash{} if this is the case are we observing heart rate (HR) changes as a consequence of breathing changes? Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls. In this review we highlight the interrelationships between HR and respiration, as well as presenting recommendations for researchers to use when collecting data for HRV assessment. Namely, we highlight the superior utility of within-subjects designs along with the importance of establishing an appropriate baseline and monitoring respiration.},

  abstract = {The calculation of heart rate variability (HRV) is a popular tool used to investigate differences in cardiac autonomic control between population samples. When interpreting effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of group differences, researchers typically use Cohen's guidelines of small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8) effects. However, these guidelines were originally proposed as a fallback for when the effect size distribution (ESD) was unknown. Despite the availability of effect sizes from hundreds of HRV studies, researchers still largely rely on Cohen's guidelines to interpret effect sizes and to perform power analyses to calculate required sample sizes for future research. This article describes an ESD analysis of 297 HRV effect sizes from between-group/case-control studies, revealing that the 25th, 50th, and 75th effect size percentiles correspond with effect sizes of 0.26, 0.51, and 0.88, respectively. The analyses suggest that Cohen's guidelines may underestimate the magnitude of small and large effect sizes and that HRV studies are generally underpowered. Therefore, to better reflect the observed ESD, effect sizes of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.9 should be interpreted as small, medium, and large effects (after rounding to the closest 0.05). Based on power calculations using the ESD, suggested sample sizes are also provided for planning suitably powered studies that are more likely to replicate. Researchers are encouraged to use the ESD data set or their own collected data sets in tandem with the provided analysis script to perform custom ESD and power analyses relevant to their specific research area.},

The method includes the following six phases: (a) preliminary organization and planning, (b) open and axial coding, (c) development of a preliminary codebook, (d) pilot testing the codebook, (e) the final coding process, and (f) reviewing the codebook and finalizing themes. These phases are supported by strategies to enhance trustworthiness, such as (a) peer debriefing, (b) researcher and data triangulation, (c) an audit trail and researcher journal, and (d) a search for negative cases.},

Factorially independent scales are constructed to measure the 5 styles of handling conflict, and an attempt is made to provide evidence of their reliability and validity. The factors affecting styles of handling conflict with superiors, subordinates, and peers have not been thoroughly studied. The empirical validity of the scales is tested against measures of role status and sex. Factor analyses of data from a national sample of executives clearly reflect the 5 a priori dimensions of conflict styles. The test-retest and internal consistency reliability coefficients for the 5 scales are satisfactory and compare favorably with other existing instruments. The discriminant analyses yield evidence of empirical validity of the scales. Moreover, 4 of the scales are free from social desirability or response distortion bias. The scales can be used in basic research, teaching, and in the diagnosis of styles of handling interpersonal conflict among the members of an organization. Additional evidence of the validity of the scales should be investigated in future studies.},

We investigate the feasibility of continuous stress measurement via two field studies using wireless physiological sensors \textemdash{} a four-week study with illicit drug users (n = 40), and a oneweek study with daily smokers and social drinkers (n = 30). We find that 11+ hours/day of usable data can be obtained in a 4-week study. Significant learning effect is observed after the first week and data yield is seen to be increasing over time even in the fourth week. We propose a framework to analyze sensor data yield and find that losses in wireless channel is negligible; the main hurdle in further improving data yield is the attachment constraint. We show the feasibility of measuring stress minutes preceding events of interest and observe the sensor-derived stress to be rising prior to self-reported stress and smoking events.},

Infant responses were used to classify them into stress reactivity profiles using three different classification schemes: hypothalamic\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal (HPA)-axis, autonomic, and multi-system. Discriminant function analyses evaluated the prenatal variables that best discriminated infant reactivity profiles within each classification scheme.

In Experiment 2, a large proportion of the sample had a recent abortion for which validation information from the clinic was available. Results of both experiments indicate that, when responding to questions about sensitive topics, survey respondents are concerned about risks and losses other than those covered by standard confidentiality assurances and that these other concerns affect truthful reporting.

The Professional Quality of Life Revision IV (ProQOL), the Areas of Work Life Survey, Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey and a Demographic Data sheet were completed by 169 FMHPs. Consistent with our hypothesis, higher levels of compassion satisfaction, lower levels of compassion fatigue, and higher overall degree of fit in the six areas of work life were predictive of lower burnout in FMHPs.},

  abstract = {Objective. To determine the prevalence of social isolation and associated factors in graduate and professional health science students. Methods. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered via an online survey from graduate and professional students in the colleges of dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and public health at a Midwestern university. Questions assessed students' demographics, weekly activity hours, support systems, and financial concerns, and included the 20-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. Logistic regression was performed using the binary outcome of feeling socially isolated (yes/no) and examined programrelated respondent comments using thematic analysis. Results. There were 427 survey respondents with 398 completing the full survey. Students answering the social isolation question (n5386) were included in the regression analysis. Nearly one-fifth (19.4\%) of respondents indicated social isolation, with the highest percentage among nursing respondents (40.7\%). Lacking a strong support, being a non-native English speaker, having caregiving responsibilities, and experiencing ``lonely'' items described in the UCLA Loneliness Scale were positively associated with social isolation. The ability to discuss feelings with friends in their professional program and experiencing ``non-lonely'' items were negatively associated with social isolation. Ninety-six comments revealed nine risk factor themes in four categories: individual (feeling different from peers, personality, employment), interpersonal (competition/exclusionary atmosphere, faculty relationship), organization (too busy with coursework, isolating program) and community (relocation reduces social support). Student-involvement in organizations (activities encouraging socialization) and community (support from outside the group) were protective factors. Conclusion. Understanding associated factors and designing strategies to reduce student social isolation may enhance the quality and well-being of future health professionals and scientists.},

The theory developed in this article bridges these subfields, arguing that organizations are racial structures?cognitive schemas connecting organizational rules to social and material resources. I begin with the proposition that race is constitutive of organizational foundations, hierarchies, and processes. Next, I develop four tenets: (1) racialized organizations enhance or diminish the agency of racial groups; (2) racialized organizations legitimate the unequal distribution of resources; (3) Whiteness is a credential; and (4) the decoupling of formal rules from organizational practice is often racialized. I argue that racialization theory must account for how both state policy and individual attitudes are filtered through?and changed by?organizations. Seeing race as constitutive of organizations helps us better understand the formation and everyday functioning of organizations. Incorporating organizations into a structural theory of racial inequality can help us better understand stability, change, and the institutionalization of racial inequality. I conclude with an overview of internal and external sources of organizational change and a discussion of how the theory of racialized organizations may set the agenda for future research.},

  abstract = {Aims Iran faces parallel human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and injection drug use epidemics; more than 62\% of known HIV cases occur among injection drug users (IDU). We conducted a formative study of IDU in Tehran to explore risk behavior in the wake of the recent harm reduction efforts. Participants and design Key informant interviews (n = 40), focus group discussions (nine groups of IDU, n = 66) and a review of existing published and unpublished literature were conducted. Participants included IDU, physicians, policy makers, police, IDU advocates and their families. IDU were diverse in gender, education, income and neighborhood of residence. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory. A typology of IDUs in Tehran, categorized according to self-defined networks as well as HIV risks, is presented. This categorization is based on the groups identified by IDUs, compared to those identified by other key informants, and on a secondary data review. Findings Homeless, female, young IDU and users of a more potent form of heroin were identified as having increased risks for HIV. Participants described shortening transitions from smoked opium to injected opiates. Whereas a majority of participants considered needle sharing less common than previously, sharing continues in locations of group injection, and in states of withdrawal or severe addiction. System-wise barriers to harm reduction were discussed, and include the cost or stigma of purchasing needles from pharmacies, over-burdened clinics, irregular enforcement of laws protecting IDU and lack of efforts to address the sexual risks of IDU. Conclusions This research is one of the first to describe a diversity of IDU, including women and higher socio-economic class individuals, in Tehran. While efforts in harm reduction in Iran to date have been notable, ongoing risks point to an urgent need for targeted, culturally acceptable interventions.},

We build on and extend this argument by focusing on intersecting group identities as a mechanism for identifying such incongruence, not only within religious contexts, but also at the intersection of categories such as gender and race. To illustrate this argument, the analysis draws on data from the 2006 Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) to assess how race, gender, and religion interact to produce different levels of attitude and behavior incongruencies on key issues of the day, specifically conservative social values and voting behaviors. The results find marked differences and inconsistent relationships between attitudes and behaviors across racial-gender groups. We use the analysis to highlight the conditions that result in incongruence at the intersections of identity categories and pinpoint where social scientists are most vulnerable to committing the congruence fallacy.},

  abstract = {In the past, research on social stratification focused primarily on the independent contributions of race, socioeconomic status (SES), and gender to status attainment. However, contemporary research in the field recognizes that race, SES, and gender interact to create complicated systems of inequality that go beyond conventional models of stratification. Increasingly, studies add categories such as religion and nativity to the mix and uncover even more complex patterns of inequality, ones that rarely fit conventional explanations for stratification outcomes, particularly for women (Fitzgerald and Glass 2008, 2012; Glass and Jacobs 2005; Lehrer 1999a; Sherkat and Darnell 1999). Consider these examples: Education is highly correlated with U.S. women's employment and earnings (England, Garcia-Beaulieu, and Ross 2004), but is much more so for native-born white and black women than for immigrant women (Read and Cohen 2007). Religion is negatively associated with women's human capital acquisition among conservative Christians (Lehrer 1999b), whereas the opposite is true among U.S. Jews (Gold 2002), and among Arab Americans, women evidence a pattern of high educational attainment, but very low labor force participation (Read and Oselin 2008). These patterns can create theoretical and empirical conundrums for researchers focused on the relationship between any single identity (e.g., race, class, gender) and social inequality. In this chapter, we examine where the presence of multiple group identities results in status attainment outcomes that do not fit neatly within conventional stratification models. We use Arab American women as a case study. This group provides a useful case because it lies at the intersection of religion and ethnicity, where the cultural dynamics shaping women's achievements are especially acute (Read 2004). Arab American women also constitute a population that exhibits a paradoxical pattern of high educational attainment but low employment (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2000). They provide a rich repository of information to examine how multiple identity categories intersect to shape outcomes.},

Participants (N=283) completed the Reassurance Seeking Scale (RSS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. An exploratory factor analysis resulted in a coherent three factor solution reflecting the need to seek excessive reassurance regarding: (1) uncertainty about decisions, (2) attachment and the security of relationships, and (3) perceived general threat and anxiety. The RSS was found to possess good internal consistency and was moderately correlated with measures of anxiety, stress, and depression. The psychometric properties of the RSS appear promising for the promotion of programmatic research on reassurance seeking and its treatment in the anxiety disorders.},

There are now over 5million Africans on HAART. This is a remarkable feat given the challenges of providing HIV care in resource-limited settings. Indeed, HAART has significantly altered the natural history of this life-threatening condition. However, as children and adults are living longer on HAART, there is increasing concern about rising incidence of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidaemia among PLWHA. This review describes how HIV infection and exposure to antiretroviral therapy can affect glycaemic control and onset of diabetic complications.

Findings show that both men and women who report high levels of religiosity are more likely to use preventative services. Denominational differences show that affiliated individuals, especially those who are Jewish, are significantly more likely to use each type of preventative care than non-affiliated individuals.

  abstract = {When sharing microdata (i.e., data on individuals) with the public, organizations face competing objectives. On the one hand, they strive to release data files that are useful for a wide range of statistical purposes and easy for secondary data users to analyze with standard statistical methods. On the other hand, they must protect the confidentiality of data subjects\~O identities and sensitive attributes from attacks by ill-intentioned data users. To address such threats, organizations typically alter microdata before sharing it with others; in fact, most public-use data sets with unrestricted access have undergone one or more disclosure protection treatments. This research synthesis reviews statistical approaches to protecting data confidentiality commonly used by government agencies and survey organizations, with particular emphasis on their impacts on the accuracy of secondary data analyses. In general terms, it discusses potential biases that can result from the disclosure treatments, as well as when and how it is possible to avoid or correct those biases. The synthesis is intended for social scientists doing secondary data analysis with microdata; it does not prescribe best practices for implementing disclosure protection methods or gauging disclosure risks when disseminating microdata.},

After examining ways to measure segregation, I summarize trends in sex segregation in the United States and cross-nationally. Occupational segregation has declined since 1970, but most workers remain in sex segregated jobs. I then evaluate the empirical support for explanations for segregation. Demand-side explanations include employers' preferences, the demand for workers, economic pressures, discrimination, and personnel practices. Supply-side explanations include the size of the labor supply, the neoclassical human-capital explanation, gender-role socialization, workers' values, and the opportunity structure. I conclude that a variety of social and economic forces operate both to perpetuate and to reduce segregation. However, workplace segregation is an important mechanism in sex stratification, and a stratification perspective stresses the importance of demand-side factors. I call for research on sex segregation that examines the behavior of all labor market actors.},

Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6-7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable.},

  abstract = {Background: The last decade has seen the burgeoning publication of male-specific depression rating scales designed to assess externalising depression symptoms (e.g., substance use, risk-taking, and aggression). These symptoms are theorised to reflect the behavioural manifestation of depression amongst men who rigidly conform to masculine norms. To date, research findings from these scales have been mixed, and each scale is limited by psychometric shortcomings or constrained assessment of symptom sub-domains. Methods: The Male Depression Risk Scale (MDRS-22) was developed from online, non-clinical, community samples. Following best-practice recommendations, initial scale items were subject to expert review. Study 1 (male n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 386) reduced the item pool via exploratory factor analysis while Study 2 (male n {$\frac{1}{4}$}499, female n {$\frac{1}{4}$}291) refined and validated the factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis. Sex and masculinity comparisons were evaluated. Results: Goodness of fit indices validated the six-factor solution with subscales assessing: emotional suppression, drug use, alcohol use, anger and aggression, somatic symptoms and risk-taking. Betweengroups analyses indicated higher MDRS-22 scores for males reporting higher conformity to masculine norms. Limitations: Data were drawn from an online community sample without use of diagnostic interview. Test-retest correlations were not evaluated. Future research should look to examine longitudinal typicalexternalising symptom trajectories across a range of clinical and non-clinical settings. Conclusions: The MDRS-22 reports satisfactory preliminary psychometric properties with validated subscales enabling multidimensional assessment of theorised externalising symptom sub-domains. MDRS-22 scale brevity may facilitate use in primary care settings enabling better identification of atrisk males.},

  abstract = {What is already known about this subject Severe obesity prevalence in adults has close to doubled from the 1990s to 2010 and is expected to double again by 2030. Over 3 million reports of child maltreatment were received by child protective services in 2008. While clinic and population-based studies have found high rates of adult psychological distress among severely obese individuals, little is known about how the experience of abuse during childhood relates to the risk of severe obesity later in life. What this study adds Using data from a nationally representative, longitudinal study, we found that incidence rates and 13-year risk of developing severe obesity in adulthood varied by abuse type. We found significantly higher risk of incident severe obesity in non-minority females and males who experienced the combined occurrence of sexual and physical abuse during childhood, relative to individuals with no history of abuse. In addition to other social and emotional risks, exposure to sexual and physical abuse during childhood may increase risk of severe obesity later in life. Background Severe obesity has increased, yet childhood antecedents of adult severe obesity are not well understood. Objective Estimate adult-onset severe obesity risk in individuals with history of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse compared with those who did not report abuse. Methods Longitudinal analysis of participants from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 10 774) wave II (1996; aged 12\textendash 22 years) followed through wave IV (2008\textendash 2009; aged 24\textendash 34 years). New cases of adult-onset severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] {$\geq$} 40 kg/m2 using measured height and weight) in individuals followed over 13 years who were not severely obese during adolescence (BMI {$<$}120\% of 95th percentile Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics growth curves). Results The combined occurrence of self-reported sexual and physical abuse during childhood was associated with an increased risk of incident severe obesity in adulthood in non-minority females (hazard ratio [HR; 95\% Confidence Interval] = 2.5; 1.3, 4.8) and males (HR = 3.6; 1.5, 8.5) compared with individuals with no history of abuse. Conclusion In addition to other social and emotional risks, exposure to sexual and physical abuse during childhood may increase risk of severe obesity later in life. Consideration of the confluence of childhood abuse might be considered as part of preventive and therapeutic approaches to address severe obesity.},

Based on interviews with 60 persons, who also share the experiences of spouses and children, this study suggests that job relocation is potentially harmful to families. Those who relocate initially experience two varieties of stress: operational stress, resulting from the new job and setting-up activities in the new community, and emotional stress resulting from family-related activities. It was found that those who relocate for work often face forced self-reliance, a lack of family support, and an increase in family demands, although the overall stress was reduced for persons taking white-collar or professional positions because of employer assistance. It was found that much of the initial stress dissipated with time, and when asked to reflect on their experiences most recast the initially difficult time as an endured challenge or learning experience. A vibrant 'sense of home', based on fond memories and people who care about them, served as an anchor for many of those studied. Strong evidence was found of a continued search for one's roots among many of the persons studied, especially those who were older who spoke of being adrift and of pursuing things at the expense of home and family while away. Many persons chose to return to their 'home' area, to work or retire, seeking to be near what was important in their lives.},

We examine its ability to assess burnout accruing from patient care practice in a rural, underserved area. Utilizing data from a cross-sectional survey of 308 rural-based medical professionals, we investigate how the three short-form subscales of the nine-item abbreviated inventory compare with their gold-standard parent subscales from the original 22-item human services scale in measuring corresponding dimensions of burnout. The findings provide significant evidence that the three-item measures are valid and reliable proxies for the long-form subscales. The short-form measures are highly correlated with the original subscales and display high convergent and discriminant validity. Each of the abbreviated subscales manifests the kind of high sensitivity with adequate specificity that one would expect to see in a good screening instrument. We conclude that the short-form measures can be utilized to rapidly screen human service professionals such as rural health care practitioners for symptoms of each of the three dimensions of burnout.},

Drawing from 120 interviews with employers as well as participant observation of a hiring committee, I argue that hiring is more than just a process of skills sorting; it is also a process of cultural matching between candidates, evaluators, and firms. Employers sought candidates who were not only competent but also culturally similar to themselves in terms of leisure pursuits, experiences, and self-presentation styles. Concerns about shared culture were highly salient to employers and often outweighed concerns about absolute productivity. I unpack the interpersonal processes through which cultural similarities affected candidate evaluation in elite firms and provide the first empirical demonstration that shared culture\textemdash particularly in the form of lifestyle markers\textemdash matters for employer hiring.

It is fully structured to allow administration by lay interviewers and scoring of diagnoses by computer. A special Substance Abuse Module covers tobacco, alcohol, and other drug abuse in considerable detail, allowing the assessment of the quality and severity of dependence and its course. This article describes the design and development of the CIDI and the current field testing of a slightly reduced "core" version. The field test is being conducted in 19 centers around the world to assess the interviews' reliability and its acceptability to clinicians and the general populace in different cultures and to provide data on which to base revisions that may be found necessary. In addition, questions to assess International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, and the revised DSM-III diagnoses are being written. If all goes well, the CIDI will allow investigators reliably to assess mental disorders according to the most widely accepted nomenclatures in many different populations and cultures.}

In Studies 1 through 3, the Single-Item Self-Esteem Scale (SISE) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) showed strong convergent validity for men and women, for different ethnic groups, and for both college students and community members. The SISE and the RSE had nearly identical correlations with a wide range of criterion measures, including domain-specific self-evaluations, self-evaluative biases, social desirability, personality, psychological and physical health, peer ratings of group behavior, academic outcomes, and demographic variables. Study 4 showed that the SISE had only moderate convergent validity in a sample of children. Overall, the findings support the reliability and validity of the SISE and suggest it can provide a practical alternative to the RSE in adult samples. More generally, the findings contribute to the research literature by further elaborating the nomological network of global self-esteem.},

This study is designed to identify particular clusters of MetS components that carry the highest risk of incident stroke. Methods\textemdash We analyzed the public use data from the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. At baseline, 14 993 stroke-free middle-aged individuals were followed-up over 9 years for incident stroke. MetS components were defined according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/American Heart Association criteria. Incident stroke was identified using a standardized incident events identification and classification protocol. Proportional hazard models were used to assess the RRs and 95\% CIs of ischemic stroke associated with MetS and its different clusters. Results\textemdash At baseline, the prevalence of MetS was 39\%. The mean age was 54, with 26\% blacks and 55\% females. The hazard ratio of incident ischemic stroke associated with MetS among women (hazard ratio, 2.41; 95\% CI, 1.69 to 3.49) and men (hazard ratio, 2.11; 95\% CI, 1.56 \textendash 2.85) was similar. There was a dose\textendash response relationship between the numbers of MetS components and the risk of incidence stroke. Persons with either elevated blood pressure or elevated fasting glucose in the clusters to form a MetS had the highest risk for incident stroke (hazard ratio, 2.74 \textendash{} 4.16 comparing to the reference group) than MetS without these 2 components (hazard ratio, Յ2.00 comparing to the reference group). Conclusions\textemdash The data support the need to target MetS, especially MetS, with these 2 highest risk components (elevated blood pressure or elevated fasting glucose) in the clusters.

In two experiments, students studied prose passages and took one or three immediate free-recall tests, without feedback, or restudied the material the same number of times as the students who received tests. Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students' confidence in their ability to remember the material. Testing is a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it.},

Here we set out to test the influence of stress-induced changes in flow rate on sAA secretion. Twenty-six subjects underwent the Trier Social Stress Test and a control condition. Saliva was sampled by passive drooling or salivettes. Saliva flow rate, sAA levels and output, salivary cortisol, and heart rate variability were measured. Flow rate increased only when sampled by passive drooling. Stress-induced increases in amylase levels were correlated with increases of amylase output but not with flow rate. Results indicate that flow rate is not a confounder of stress-induced sAA activation and suggest that valid measurements of sAA can be obtained by salivettes without the need for assessment of flow rate.},

Specifically, we explain the unity of the virtues thesis, which suggests that individual virtues may be a part of a larger overarching construct, which we propose may be practical wisdom, or simply general virtuousness. Similarly, we propose that a common mechanism, such as automatic self-regulation, may facilitate these virtuous expressions. Thus, despite differences in content and expression, most virtues may have a common overarching construct and undergirding mechanism.},

To quantitatively explore the novel possibility of person-to-person spread and network-level determination of depressive symptoms, analyses were performed on a densely interconnected social network of 12 067 people assessed repeatedly over 32 years as part of the Framingham Heart Study. Longitudinal statistical models were used to examine whether depressive symptoms in one person were associated with similar scores in friends, co-workers, siblings, spouses and neighbors. Depressive symptoms were assessed using CES-D scores that were available for subjects in three waves measured between 1983 and 2001. Results showed both low and high CES-D scores (and classification as being depressed) in a given period were strongly correlated with such scores in one's friends and neighbors. This association extended up to three degrees of separation (to one's friends' friends' friends). Female friends appear to be especially influential in the spread of depression from one person to another. The results are robust to multiple network simulation and estimation methods, suggesting that network phenomena appear relevant to the epidemiology of depression and would benefit from further study.},

  abstract = {Catholic priests are faced with innumerable demands, unrealistic expectations, and few tangible results. Moreover, in today's society, there are fewer priests, even greater demands, and a surrounding culture that is increasingly secular and apparently less supportive. Thus, burnout in Catholic clergy is commonly presumed to be high. The purpose of this study was to move beyond assumptions and explore the real extent of burnout among Roman Catholic clergy (using a standardized test of burnout) and then to explore those variables that were statistically related to burnout. A sample of 2,482 Catholic priests across the United States was given the Maslach Burnout Inventory. They scored significantly less burned out than Maslach Burnout Inventory norm groups that included a general sample and that also included those who were male or who worked in social services or medicine. When investigating those variables that were associated with burnout, exercise and taking time off were significantly correlated to lower levels of burnout; however, the effect was small. The more important variables associated with burnout were job satisfaction, inner peace, childhood psychological problems, relationship to God, and good friends. On these more important variables, priests reported high levels of health and well-being. A large majority indicated being happy as priests and reported having good friendships, satisfaction with their relationship to God, a limited history of childhood psychological problems, and a strong sense of inner peace. For Catholic priests, and likely for all people, strong psychological and spiritual support systems seem to be most important in preventing burnout, especially for those engaged in the demanding positions of caring for others.

  abstract = {To describe the case of Congo as an example of the assessment and appropriateness of donor operational and sectoral strategies in a complex emergency. The paper reports the findings of an external evaluation of operations financed by the European Commission Humanitarian Office in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Congolese health system is suffering from severe deterioration. What is functioning in the public health context is donor-dependent with high costs and limited coverage. Despite a relatively favourable agro-climatic situation, food shortage and famine severely affect the nutritional status of large population groups. In this context, humanitarian programmes have generally improved access to health care and the nutritional status of beneficiaries. The reduction of malnutrition in project areas is often demonstrated even though the context did not permit consolidation of these results. Malnutrition continues to claim a massive cost of lives owing to the effect of widespread food insecurity that follows a circular cause-and-effect pattern of very low food production and extreme poverty. The current context in DRC does not correspond yet to `post-crisis': neither at population level with regard to indicators of poverty, malnutrition, disease and death, nor at institutional level, with regard to state support to institutions. In these situations, the international community is often called upon to replace the state as service provider. Integrated humanitarian actions should be the future of relief projects in DRC. Health, nutrition and food security components should be considered a standard public health intervention strategy representing the most sensible approach to address the needs of the affected population.},

  abstract = {Objective: The present meta-analysis aimed to assess the risk of incident diabetes associated with clinical depression, depressive symptoms, or both in nondiabetic subjects. Data Sources: We performed a MEDLINE search for studies published in the English language using the search string diabetes AND (depression OR antidepressant). The search included studies from any date to December 30, 2011. Study Selection: 1,898 studies were independently assessed for eligibility, and longitudinal studies that assessed the risk of incident diabetes in subjects with or without clinical depression were selected. Data Extraction: Study design and characteristics were verified for each study. A meta-analysis was performed for unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios of incident diabetes in subjects with depression by using a random-effects model. Additional analyses were performed to assess heterogeneity, publication bias, and specific hazard ratios for diabetes associated with antidepressant drug use. Results: The 23 studies included in the metaanalysis enrolled 424,557 subjects, with a mean follow-up of 8.3 years and 19,977 cases of incident diabetes. A higher incidence of diabetes was found in depressed versus nondepressed subjects (0.72\% vs 0.47\% yearly), with unadjusted and adjusted risk (95\% CI) of 1.56 (1.37\textendash 1.77) and 1.38 (1.23\textendash 1.55), respectively (both P values {$<$}\,.001). The use of antidepressant drugs and untreated depression were associated with an adjusted risk of diabetes of 1.68 (1.17\textendash 2.40) (P\,=\,.005) and 1.56 (0.92\textendash 2.65) (P\,=\,.09). Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are associated with a significantly increased risk for incident diabetes. This association cannot be entirely explained by the use of antidepressant drugs or being overweight. Pathogenetic mechanisms connecting depression with diabetes deserve further exploration. Depression should be included among risk factors that indicate intensified screening for diabetes.

Methods: From a cohort of 595 persons at high risk (prostitutes, injecting drug users, and sexual partners of these persons) and nearly 6000 identified contacts, we examined the social networks of a subset of 96 persons who were interviewed once per year for 3 years. We assessed their network configuration, network stability, and changes in risk configuration and risk behavior using epidemiologic and social network analysis, and visualization techniques. Results: Some significant decrease in personal risk-taking was documented during the course of the study, particularly with regard to needle-sharing. The size and number of connected components (groups that are completely connected) declined. Microstructures (small subgroups of persons that interact intensely) were either not present, or declined appreciably during the period of observation. Conclusions: In this area of low prevalence, the lack of endogenous transmission of HIV may be related in part to the lack of a network structure that fosters active propagation, despite the continued presence of risky behaviors. Although the relative contribution of network structure and personal behavior cannot be ascertained from these data, the study suggests an important role for network configuration in the transmission dynamics of HIV. \textcopyright{} 1998 Lippincott-Raven Publishers},

This study examined whether maternal HF-HRV during pregnancy mediates the association between depressed mood and gestational hypertension. Depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale) and HF-HRV were measured during early (M = 14.9 weeks) and late (M = 32.4 weeks) pregnancy in 287 women. Gestational hypertension was determined by chart review. Depressive symptoms were associated with less HF-HRV (b = -0.02, p =.001). There was an indirect effect of depressed mood on gestational hypertension through late pregnancy HF-HRV (b = 0.04, 95\% CI 0.0038, 0.1028) after accounting for heart rate. These findings suggest cardiac vagal control is a possible pathway through which prenatal depressed mood is associated with gestational hypertension, though causal ordering remains uncertain.},

This is despite lesbians and gay men being at heightened risk of mood disorders and likely to benefit from having access to tailored self-help resources. Objective: We sought to determine how e-therapies for depression and anxiety could be improved to address the therapeutic needs of lesbians and gay men. Methods: We conducted eight focus groups with lesbians and gay men aged 18 years and older. Focus groups were presented with key modules from the popular e-therapy ``MoodGYM''. They were asked to evaluate the inclusiveness and relevance of these modules for lesbians and gay men and to think about ways that e-therapies in general could be modified. The focus groups were analyzed qualitatively using a thematic analysis approach to identify major themes. Results: The focus groups indicated that some but not all aspects of MoodGYM were suitable, and suggested ways of improving e-therapies for lesbian and gay users. Suggestions included avoiding language or examples that assumed or implied users were heterosexual, improving inclusiveness by representing non-heterosexual relationships, providing referrals to specialized support services and addressing stigma-related stress, such as ``coming out'' and experiences of discrimination and harassment. Focus group participants suggested that dedicated e-therapies for lesbians and gay men should be developed or general e-therapies be made more inclusive by using adaptive logic to deliver content appropriate for a user's sexual identity. Conclusions: Findings from this study offer in-depth guidance for developing e-therapies that more effectively address mental health problems among lesbians and gay men.},

In addition, there were significant associations between all sources of support with depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-esteem, and academic adjustment, but fewer significant unique effects of each source. Parental support was a robust unique predictor of adjustment for both boys and girls, and classmates' support was a robust unique predictor for boys.

Given the scarcity of studies found on the subject, a broad selection criterion ~was used, which included~quantitative, qualitative and mixed studies, literature reviews and comparative studies with other professions. The results reveal various risk factors: work overload among younger generations of priests, a sociocultural context that distrusts the clergy, neurotic, introverted, perfectionist and narcissistic personality styles, avoidant and complacent coping styles, living alone, not having sufficient support (especially from the Church authorities), excessive demands and lack of boundaries related to the priestly role and submissive obedience styles, among others. However, the studies reviewed also identified important protection factors: promoting optimism, an approach-based coping style and a collaborative way of resolving conflicts, frequent physical exercise, eating a balanced diet, finding time to rest, strengthening personal identity, social support (from parishioners, collaborators, colleagues, superiors) and leading an active spiritual life. Stress and burnout are associated with certain pathologies linked to~smoking, alcoholism, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depression. Strengthening protective factors and minimizing the impact of risk factors would do much to improve the clergy's occupational health.},

  abstract = {Researchers argue that white evangelical Christians are likely to support teaching creationism in public schools. Yet, less is known about the role religion may play in shaping attitudes toward evolution and teaching creationism among blacks and Latinos, who are overrepresented in U.S. conservative Protestant traditions. This study fills a gap in the literature by examining whether religious factors (e.g., religious affiliation and Biblical literalism) relate to differences in support for teaching creationism between blacks and Latinos compared to whites and other racial groups. Using a nationally representative survey (N = 9,425), we find that although black and Latino Americans support teaching creationism more than other groups, religion plays a stronger role among blacks in shaping support for teaching creationism instead of evolution. Results add an important racial dimension to scholarly discussions on religion and science and suggest further exploration of race alongside other factors that may contribute to support for teaching creationism.},

However, because of the nature of these groups, it is difficult to collect accurate information about them, and this difficulty complicates disease prevention efforts. A recently developed statistical approach called respondent-driven sampling improves our ability to study hidden populations by allowing researchers to make unbiased estimates of the prevalence of certain traits in these populations. Yet, not enough is known about the sample-to-sample variability of these prevalence estimates. In this paper, we present a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around respondent-driven sampling estimates and demonstrate in simulations that it outperforms the naive method currently in use. We also use simulations and real data to estimate the design effects for respondent-driven sampling in a number of situations. We conclude with practical advice about the power calculations that are needed to determine the appropriate sample size for a study using respondent-driven sampling. In general, we recommend a sample size twice as large as would be needed under simple random sampling.},

  abstract = {\DH Today's globally networked society places great demand on the dissemination and sharing of information. While in the past released information was mostly in tabular and statistical form, many situations call today for the release of specific data (microdata). In order to protect the anonymity of the entities (called respondents) to which information refers, data holders often remove or encrypt explicit identifiers such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. Deidentifying data, however, provides no guarantee of anonymity. Released information often contains other data, such as race, birth date, sex, and ZIP code, that can be linked to publicly available information to reidentify respondents and inferring information that was not intended for disclosure. In this paper we address the problem of releasing microdata while safeguarding the anonymity of the respondents to which the data refer. The approach is based on the definition of k-anonymity. A table provides k-anonymity if attempts to link explicitly identifying information to its content map the information to at least k entities. We illustrate how k-anonymity can be provided without compromising the integrity (or truthfulness) of the information released by using generalization and suppression techniques. We introduce the concept of minimal generalization that captures the property of the release process not to distort the data more than needed to achieve k-anonymity, and present an algorithm for the computation of such a generalization. We also discuss possible preference policies to choose among different minimal generalizations.},

Burnout is in turn related to psychological distress. Social support from informal sources is a factor with potential to reduce the psychological distress caused by burnout. However, the previous research has not considered informal social support in sufficient detail. This article, using a cross-sectional study, analyses the relationship between burnout, informal social support and psychological distress in a sample of social workers in Spain (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 189). The results show a high incidence of psychological distress and burnout, above all in terms of Emotional Exhaustion (EE). The results of the hierarchical regression analysis confirm the importance of informal social support as a variable negatively related to distress, even in the presence of burnout. Surprisingly, organisational variables were not associated with distress. Longitudinal and qualitative research is necessary to examine the nature of this relationship in detail.},

Results Perceived stress decreased by 31.57\% in the yoga group and increased by 6.60\% in the control group (P = 0.001). During a guided relaxation period in the yoga group, compared with values obtained before a practice session, the high-frequency band of the heart rate variability spectrum (parasympathetic) increased by 64\% in the 20th week and by 150\% in the 36th week, and both the low-frequency band (sympathetic), and the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio were concomitantly reduced (P {$<$} 0.001 between the 2 groups). Moreover, the low-frequency band remained decreased after deep relaxation in the 36th week in the yoga group.

Results We found five longitudinal studies, of which two observed an increase in work-related stressors to be associated with higher hair cortisol, one found a relation with lower hair cortisol and one did not find a relationship. Findings of cross-sectional studies were also mixed. The one available longitudinal study regarding mental health showed that hair cortisol was not related to depressive symptoms. Conclusions Hair cortisol measurement within occupational health research is still in its early stage and more longitudinal studies are urgently needed to clarify its relationship with work-related stressors and perceived stress before hair cortisol can be used to identify workers at risk for mental health problems.},

We propose two alternative mechanisms\textemdash avoidance and withdrawal\textemdash that can produce depression homophily in the absence of preference. These alternative mechanisms create homophily indirectly by limiting friendship partners available to depressed individuals. We test the preference, avoidance, and withdrawal mechanisms using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a dynamic network model. Results provide support for the withdrawal mechanism. These findings help explain how depression affects friend selection and have broader implications for understanding selection mechanisms responsible for network patterns such as homophily.},

As a window into this discussion, I examine the close social networks of American adults and consider whether religious traditionalists are more likely than other network members to supply several basic forms of social support. Analysis of the Portraits of American Life Survey reveals three main findings. First, a majority of Americans\textemdash religious or not\textemdash count at least one perceived religious traditionalist among their close network ties. Second, American adults are more likely to receive advice, practical help, and money from ties identified as religious traditionalists than from other types of ties, a pattern that held among both kin and nonkin network ties. Finally, although perceived traditionalist network members appear especially inclined to assist highly religious people, they nevertheless offer social support to Americans across a broad spectrum of religiosity. Beyond its relevance for debates on religion and community life, this study also proposes a novel strategy to assess prosocial behavior. Asking people to recount the deeds of their network members can reduce certain self-reporting biases common to survey research and helps locate prosocial activity in concrete and meaningful social relationships.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study is (1) to investigate the impact of patient demands on primary care physicians' burnout and (2) to examine the stability and change of burnout across time. Participants were drawn from the official Dutch registration system for primary health care, and longitudinal panel data (n= 165) from three waves with a 5-year time interval were used. They filled in the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a validated scale for the assessment of patient demands. The results of various stability and change models that were tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) indicated that demanding patient contacts lead to increased burnout among physicians. In addition, the findings suggested that about one quarter of the variance in physician's actual burnout levels across one decade is accounted for by a stable component, whereas about three quarters is accounted for by a change component. Hence, physician burnout seems to be a rather chronic condition that may be aggravated by exposure to demanding patients.},

While this trend has been well documented, some of the underlying dynamics and consequences have not been fully appreciated or explicated. We examine the General Social Survey in the period from 1972 to 2014 to examine how the increase in the `nones' is tied to changes in the strength of religious identity among US adults and, in turn, how the rise of the nones has affected the relationships between religious identity, religious belief, and religious behavior. In particular, we show that, as the percentage of US adults who do not identify with a religion has grown, the correlations between religious identification, belief, and behavior have increased. In short, the rise of the nones has led to more congruence between measures of religion.},

  abstract = {Survey estimates are often affected by non-sampling errors due to missing data, coverage error, and measurement or response error. Such non-sampling errors can be difficult to assess, and possibly correct for, using information from a single survey. Thus, combining information from multiple surveys can be beneficial. In addition, combining information from multiple surveys can help to reduce sampling error. This article describes four examples of projects undertaken by researchers within and outside the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in which information from multiple surveys was combined to adjust for non-sampling errors and thereby enhance estimation of various measures of health. The four projects can be described briefly as follows: (1) combining estimates from a survey of households and a survey of nursing homes to extend coverage; (2) using information from an interview survey to bridge the transition in race reporting in the United States census; (3) combining information from an examination survey and an interview survey to improve on analyses of self-reported data; and (4) combining information from two interview surveys to enhance small-area estimation. The article highlights the goals, techniques, and results from the four projects and discusses issues that can arise when information is combined from multiple surveys.

Second, although the clergy earnings disadvantage appears to have increased over the last 40 years relative to their educational peers, the picture changes when we exclude the highest income occupations. Clergy have lost ground to doctors, lawyers, and investment bankers, but they have gained ground relative to everyone else. Third, these gains are largely because of decline in the number of hours clergy report working. Fourth, we show that clergy working in churches earn less than clergy working elsewhere. Fifth, we document immediate wage penalties for those who become clergy and, among clergy, for those who begin to work in congregations. Overall, although clergy still earn less than comparable workers, their position has improved in recent decades relative to all but the highest earning occupations.},

However, the assessment of stress reactivity remains challenging, and there is a relative lack of questionnaires reliably assessing this construct. We here present the Perceived Stress Reactivity Scale (PSRS), a 23-item questionnaire with 5 subscales and 1 overall scale, based on an existing German-language instrument. Perceived stress reactivity and related constructs were assessed in N ϭ 2,040 participants from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany. The 5-factor structure of the PSRS was found to be similar in the 3 countries. In the U.S. sample the questionnaire was applied using 2 modes of administration (paper\textendash pencil and computerized), and measures were repeated after 4 weeks. Measurement invariance analyses demonstrated full invariance across mode of administration and partial invariance across gender and countries. Scale scores differed between countries and genders, with women scoring higher on most scales. Overall, reliability analysis suggested good stability of PSRS scores over a 4-week period, and validation analysis showed expected associations with related constructs such as self-efficacy, neuroticism, chronic stress, and perceived stress. Perceived stress reactivity was also associated with depressive symptoms and sleep. These associations were particularly strong when individuals scoring high on perceived stress reactivity were exposed to chronic stress. In sum, our findings suggest that the PSRS is a useful and easy-to-administer instrument to assess perceived stress reactivity.},

But the rise in precarious work also involves a major shift in its temporal dimension, such that many workers now experience routine instability in their work schedules. This temporal instability represents a fundamental and under-appreciated manifestation of the risk shift from firms to workers. A lack of suitable existing data, however, has precluded investigation of how precarious scheduling practices affect workers' health and well-being. We use an innovative approach to collect survey data from a large and strategically selected segment of the U.S. workforce: hourly workers in the service sector. These data reveal that exposure to routine instability in work schedules is associated with psychological distress, poor sleep quality, and unhappiness. Low wages are also associated with these outcomes, but unstable and unpredictable schedules are much more strongly associated. Precarious schedules affect worker well-being in part through the mediating influence of household economic insecurity, yet a much larger proportion of the association is driven by work-life conflict. The temporal dimension of work is central to the experience of precarity and an important social determinant of well-being.},

An initial empirical test of the model is conducted in a sample of ethnically diverse adolescents (N ϭ 406) who are primarily Christian or nonreligious. Religiousness and spirituality are predictors of the virtue of patience, which then predicts use of the emotion regulation strategy of cognitive reappraisal; all these variables are then tested as direct and indirect predictors of regulated behavior and well-being. Overall, results support our theoretical model that spirituality and religion predict higher patience, which facilitates the employment of adaptive emotion regulation strategies that predict better life outcomes. Implications and future research questions stemming from the theoretical model are discussed.},

Using the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, the author specifically explores transitions between progressive quintiles on the K10 scale of psychological distress using a continuation ratio model. The results reveal that the risk factors sociologists have explored almost exclusively using dimensional measures (e.g., schooling, income, subjective status, life events, social support, marriage) have effects that are generally consistent across the range of symptom severities, whether in terms of transitioning from no symptoms to average unhappiness or from average unhappiness to major depression. Indeed, for a few distal causes, including schooling and income, the association grows stronger with more severe symptoms, whereas for some proximate causes, including traumatic life events and headache, the association grows weaker. Although the results encourage sociologists to remain confident in the power of social risk factors, they complicate debates regarding what a ``normal'' response to stress is. Normal has no natural benchmark that can be identified using the range of effects associated with social risk factors.},

The specter of a faith defined by full pews and empty altars hangs heavy over the church.The root cause of this priest shortage is the church's insistence on mandatory celibacy. Given the potential recruitment advantages of abandoning the celibacy requirement, why, Richard A. Schoenherr asks, is the conservative Catholic coalition--headed by the pope--so adamantly opposed to a married clergy? The answer, he argues, is that accepting married priests would be but the first step toward ordaining women and thus forever altering the demographics of a resolutely male religious order.Yet Schoenherr believes that such change is not only necessary but unavoidable if the church is to thrive. The church's current stop-gap approach of enlisting laypeople to perform all but the central element of the mass only further serves to undermine the power of the celibate priesthood. Perhaps most importantly, doctrinal changes, a growing pluralism in the church, and the feminist movement among nuns and laywomen are exerting a growing influence on Catholicism.Concluding that the collapse of celibate exclusivity is all but inevitable, Goodbye Father presents an urgent and compelling portrait of the future of organized Catholicism.},

Resignations from the priestly ranks is a major component of the decline. We present here demographic data from priest population registers, created from a random sample of 86 U.S. dioceses, which document high to moderate resignation rates from 1966 through 1984. Further descriptive analysis shows that a typical cohort of priests recruited about the time of the Second Vatican Council will lose 37\% of its members through resignations within 25 years of ordination. In a regression model, using the diocese as the unit of analysis, we discovered that ecological and organizational conditions had a consistent influence on resignation rates in both 1970 and 1980. Based on the combined results of research to date, we conclude that a stable multi-level set of social forces has produced, and for some time will probably continue to produce, moderately high levels of voluntary attrition from the Catholic priesthood.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigated endocrine and autonomic stress responses after repeated psychosocial stress. A first goal of the study was to investigate whether peripheral catecholamines and cardiovascular parameters would show similar or different habituation patterns after repeated stress. The second aim was to detect possible subgroups with regard to individual habituation patterns in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and monitor their respective sympathetic stress responses. METHODS: Sixty-five healthy subjects (19-45 years), 38 men and 27 women, were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) three times with a 4-week interval between stress sessions. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), plasma cortisol, salivary cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and heart rates were measures repeatedly before and after each stress exposure. RESULTS: All endocrine measures as well as heart rates increased significantly after each of the three stress sessions (F values {$>$}16.00, all p values {$<$}.01). Although salivary free cortisol, total plasma cortisol, ACTH, and heart rate stress responses showed a significant decrease across the three stress sessions (all F values {$>$} 5.8, p {$<$}.01), no such decrease could be observed for the levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine. A cluster analysis performed on the salivary free cortisol responses to all three stress sessions revealed two response groups consisting of 30 so-called "high responders" and 35 "low responders." The high responders also showed larger ACTH and total plasma cortisol responses compared with the low responders (all F values {$>$} 10.00, p {$<$}.01). No such differences between high and low responders could be observed with regard to catecholamine and heart rate responses. CONCLUSIONS: From these data we conclude that habituation to psychosocial stress seems to be specific for a given response system. Although HPA responses quickly habituate, the sympathetic nervous system shows rather uniform activation patterns with repeated exposure to psychosocial challenge.},

We consider the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple masculinities approach, proposing that further insights into the social construction of gender and the dynamics of male domination can be gained by focusing analytic attention on manhood acts and how they elicit deference from others. We interpret the literature in terms of what it tells us about how males learn to perform manhood acts, about how and why such acts vary, and about how manhood acts reproduce gender inequality. We end with suggestions for further research on the practices and processes through which males construct the category "men" and themselves as its members.},

This study aims to identify gender differences in psychopathology, treatment, and public health consequences in patients with MDD. Methods Baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were used, including 1115 participants (364 men, 751 women, mean age 41 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of current MDD. Characteristics studied included symptom profiles, comorbidity, treatment, and public health consequences. Results Women reported a younger age of onset of single (27.8 years vs. 31.6 years; p=0.001) and recurrent MDD (24.8 years vs. 27.6 years; p=0.014), a higher comorbidity of panic disorder with agoraphobia (24.9\% vs. 17.3\%; p=0.006) and life-time overall anxiety disorder (77.6\% vs. 71.4\%; p=0.029) than men. More men than women suffered from comorbid alcohol dependence or abuse (48.1\% vs. 24.5\%; p{$<$}0.001). An increased prevalence of atypical depression in women (24.6\% vs. 17.3\%; p=0.009) was found. Women were treated more frequently by an alternative caretaker (20.6\% vs. 14.8\%; p=0.025), men more often in mental health care organizations (61.0\% vs. 53.7\%; p=0.025). No gender differences in frequency of medication use or counseling were found. Limitations Cross sectional design. Conclusions Main gender differences in the clinical presentation of MDD concerned a younger age of onset, higher anxiety and lower alcohol use comorbidity and higher prevalence of atypical depression in women. These differences were accompanied by differences in health care use.},

Much of this disagreement stems from the inability to distinguish between period and cohort effects when analyzing repeated cross-sectional survey data. I use the intrinsic estimator, a recently developed method of simultaneously estimating age, period, and cohort effects, to examine changes in Americans' religious service attendance, prayer, belief in the afterlife, and biblical literalism. Results show that regular service attendance declines, predominantly across cohorts. There are also period- and cohort-based declines in biblical literalism and a cohort-based decline in prayer. Belief in the afterlife is relatively stable across periods and cohorts. These results provide mixed support for theories of religious decline, and they demonstrate the importance of differentiating between period and cohort effects on social change.},

Pastoral ministry in the rural Missionary Baptist church can be especially challenging given its location and the stigma that comes along with ministry in the rural area. This dissertation will identify the potential issues of the pastoral ministry in the rural Missionary Baptist churches of the Southeast District Association of Butler and Crenshaw Counties, Alabama. These threats are potential causes of pastoral burnout and ministry failure. They are key factors in causing many to leave the pastoral ministry or causing them to leave the pastorate in the rural area. This will be a qualitative study of 20-25 pastors in the Southeast District Association of Missionary Baptist churches in the rural areas of Butler and Crenshaw Counties, Alabama. The project will primarily entail an interview of what these pastors identify are their setbacks and hindrances in ministry. It will delve into the demographics of the ministries to include: education, salary, benefits and whether or not they are now or have been bivocational and what role these elements played in how effective or ineffective they are, or have been, in ministry. In addition to the pastors, it shall also include a quantitative study of approximately 100 lay church members. This part of the study will be done by survey of each member to span across 20-25 churches in the association. This survey will ask questions of what they expect of the pastor. It will also ask questions to give statistics on how they understand pastoral ministry as an association in the areas of pastoral compensation, benefits, and educational requirements. This research gathered through the interviews will be weighed against the statistical information compiled through surveying the laity. This information will be compared and contrasted to expose the disconnect in the views of pastorate that cause the perils that may lead to ministry burnout and ministry failure. With these factors being identified, it is hoped that this study will aid new and prospective pastors in their pastoral positions in the rural Missionary Baptist churches of the Southeast District Association.},

We contextualize our findings in rural environments, a reality that puts pastors in the position of ministering to their congregations but also performing an array of social services for which they never received training. Our findings suggest that rural pastors suffer an appreciable degree of loneliness and isolation. While some conditions improved over the course of the program, the participants continued to struggle with the structural and organizational barriers endemic to daily life as a rural minister. This intervention appears to have helped participants enhance their professional aptitudes, reduce their reported degree of loneliness, and connect horizontally with other congregational leaders. However, the program did not catalyze greater self-care among pastors, which may be a result of their perceiving self-care as a luxury. Finally, the data suggest that pastors attempt to make their lives better by reaching inside themselves rather than trying to connect with others. Loneliness\textemdash which may be ingrained in the job itself\textemdash remains the most robust explanatory variable, exhibiting a strong relationship with other variables such as burnout and professional excellence.},

Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a commonly used method to correct this bias. It is also used to adjust for unequal sampling fractions in sample surveys. This article is a review of the use of IPW in epidemiological research. We describe how the bias in the complete-case analysis arises and how IPW can remove it. IPW is compared with multiple imputation (MI) and we explain why, despite MI generally being more efficient, IPW may sometimes be preferred. We discuss the choice of missingness model and methods such as weight truncation, weight stabilisation and augmented IPW. The use of IPW is illustrated on data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort.},

  abstract = {Background Fasting glucose is the standard measure used to diagnose diabetes in the United States. Recently, glycated hemoglobin was also recommended for this purpose. Methods We compared the prognostic value of glycated hemoglobin and fasting glucose for identifying adults at risk for diabetes or cardiovascular disease. We measured glycated hemoglobin in whole-blood samples from 11,092 black or white adults who did not have a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease and who attended the second visit (occurring in the 1990\textendash 1992 period) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Results The glycated hemoglobin value at baseline was associated with newly diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes. For glycated hemoglobin values of less than 5.0\%, 5.0 to less than 5.5\%, 5.5 to less than 6.0\%, 6.0 to less than 6.5\%, and 6.5\% or greater, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95\% confidence intervals) for diagnosed diabetes were 0.52 (0.40 to 0.69), 1.00 (reference), 1.86 (1.67 to 2.08), 4.48 (3.92 to 5.13), and 16.47 (14.22 to 19.08), respectively. For coronary heart disease, the hazard ratios were 0.96 (0.74 to 1.24), 1.00 (reference), 1.23 (1.07 to 1.41), 1.78 (1.48 to 2.15), and 1.95 (1.53 to 2.48), respectively. The hazard ratios for stroke were similar. In contrast, glycated hemoglobin and death from any cause were found to have a J-shaped association curve. All these associations remained significant after adjustment for the baseline fasting glucose level. The association between the fasting glucose levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease or death from any cause was not significant in models with adjustment for all covariates as well as glycated hemoglobin. For coronary heart disease, measures of risk discrimination showed significant improvement when glycated hemoglobin was added to models including fasting glucose. Conclusions In this community-based population of nondiabetic adults, glycated hemoglobin was similarly associated with a risk of diabetes and more strongly associated with risks of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause as compared with fasting glucose. These data add to the evidence supporting the use of glycated hemoglobin as a diagnostic test for diabetes.},

  abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24\,h, short-term (\textasciitilde 5\,min), and ultra-short-term ({$<$}5\,min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from \textasciitilde 2\,min to 24\,h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24\,h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

Using a prospective, cohort-controlled design, the study found participants in the MBSR program reported significant declines in stress, negative affect, rumination, state and trait anxiety, and significant increases in positive affect and self-compassion.

Clinical observation is taught primarily through preceptor modelling during the all-important clinical years. No single method exists for communicating these skills, and medical educators have periodically experimented with using arts-based training to hone observational acuity. The purpose of this qualitative study was to better understand the similarities and differences between arts-based and clinical teaching approaches to convey observation and pattern recognition skills. Method A total of 38 Year 3 students participated in either small group training with clinical photographs and paper cases (group 1), or small group training using art plus dance (group 2), both consisting of 3 2-hour sessions over a 6-month period. Findings Students in both conditions found value in the training they received and, by both self- and instructor-report, appeared to hone observation skills and improve pattern recognition. The clinically based condition appeared to have been particularly successful in conveying pattern recognition concepts to students, probably because patterns presented in this condition had specific correspondence with actual clinical situations, whereas patterns in art could not be generalised so easily to patients. In the arts-based conditions, students also developed skills in emotional recognition, cultivation of empathy, identification of story and narrative, and awareness of multiple perspectives. Conclusion The interventions studied were naturally complementary and, taken together, can bring greater texture to the process of teaching clinical medicine by helping us see a more complete `picture' of the patient.},

Three areas that emerged from qualitative interviews with women who were current and former churchgoers are addressed. First, women described their `church as family' because of personal histories of attending with family and family-like relationships. Second, the resonance between family and church practices and spaces mapped onto other geographies such as gender. Third, experiences of belonging were narrated through the trope `church as family', yet disrupted by racial and classed encounters. The women's experiences demonstrate that intimate practices and spaces of family are permeable and not necessarily bound to conventional formations or sites. They can stretch beyond the household into other spaces, such as church, whereby congregational members are part of kin networks or become `chosen families' or a `personal community' that is familial. By looking at this interrelationship, the ways in which people `do family' may offer insights into how and why people may `do church'.},

Studies examining its structure primarily have used an exploratory factor analytic technique, but yielded discrepant results. There also is a lack of research that investigates whether the clustering pattern is similar across sex and ethnic groups. This study uses confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the factor structure of the MS and examines its similarity between men and women and across three ethnic groups (Caucasian, African, and Cuban Americans). METHOD: A hierarchical four-factor model with an overarching MS factor uniting insulin resistance, obesity, lipid, and blood pressure factors was tested with 517 individuals from the Miami Community Health Study. RESULTS: Findings show that the proposed structure was well supported (comparative fit index Z 0.97) and similar between men and women and across ethnic groups. The MS was represented strongly by insulin resistance, followed by obesity, lipid factors, and, to a lesser extent, a blood pressure factor. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical support for identifying and diagnosing the MS by its component factors in a diverse population.

This is despite a commitment, in policy and practice, to Prevention as an underlying theme for services. When referral is followed by a failure to access services, the coping strategies of the parents, in particular the mother, who is generally the primary caregiver, become of particular practical importance. These coping strategies are also of theoretical interest, being a key element of the newly developed concept of Proto Prevention, which extends our previous understanding of this area. This paper focuses on the coping strategies of families who were unsuccessful applicants for Children's Services, and asks: Which coping strategies were most effective in securing positive outcomes? It was found that the direct actions of the mother, and avoidance strategies such as denial or acceptance had little effect. However, seeking social support was associated with more positive outcomes in child development and parenting, and denial and disengagement with an increase in depression symptoms. The implications of these findings, for policy and practice, are discussed.},

Multitrait scaling analyses supported the dimensionality of four functional support scales (emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interaction) and the construction of an overall functional social support index. These support measures are distinct from structural measures of social support and from related health measures. They are reliable (all Alphas {$>$}0.91), and are fairly stable over time.

Heterogeneous ordinal logistic regression models show that these religious and political factors have become more important over the last two decades. Cohorts born after 1945 became substantially more supportive of marriage rights between 1988 and 2008, but shifts in support for marriage rights were less sizeable for persons affiliated with sectarian denominations, religious fundamentalists, Republicans, and political conservatives.

Virtual reality (VR) has successfully been applied to ensure a greater degree of efficiency and standardization in the TSST. Studies using the TSST in VR (VR-TSST) have reported significant stress reactions, with subjective and peripheral physiological reactions comparable to those in response to the in vivo TSST and with lower cortisol reactions. The current study examined whether an additional virtual competitive factor triggers larger stress responses than a standard VR-TSST. Forty-five male participants were randomly assigned to either in vivo TSST, VR-TSST (VR) or VR-TSST with a virtual competitor (VR+). A significant increase of self-reported stress, electrodermal activity, and heart rate indicated a pronounced stress reaction with no differences between groups. For salivary cortisol, however, responder rates differed significantly between groups, with in vivo participants showing overall higher response rates (86\%) than participants of both VR groups (VR: 33\%, VR+: 47\%). In contrast, participants of both VR groups judged the task significantly more challenging than did in vivo TSST participants. In sum, our results indicate successful stress induction in all experimental conditions, and a marked dissociation of salivary cortisol levels on the one hand, and the physiological and psychological stress reactions on the other hand. The competitive scenario did not significantly enhance stress reactions. VR technology may serve as a standardized tool for inducing social stress in experimental settings, but further research is needed to clarify why the stress reaction as assessed by cortisol differs from peripheral and subjective stress reactions in VR.},

Results: Of the sample, 20.1\% reported significant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) score, {$>$}5), the majority of whom had mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) score, 5\textendash 9). Even among individuals with severe depressive symptoms, a large percentage (36.9\%) received no treatment from a mental health professional or with antidepressant medication. Of those taking antidepressants, 26.4\% reported mild depressive symptoms and 18.8\% had moderate, moderately severe, or severe depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Despite greater awareness and treatment of depression in primary care settings, the prevalence of depressive symptoms remains high, treatment levels remain low, and control of depressive symptoms are suboptimal. Primary care providers need to continue to focus their efforts on diagnosing and effectively treating this important disease. (J Am Board Fam Med 2011;24: 33\textendash 38.)},

An analysis of resulting income elasticity estimates revealed that households consider religious giving a necessity good at all levels of income, while other categories of giving are generally found to be luxury goods. Further, those who gave to religion were found to give more to education and charity then those not giving to religion, and higher education households were more likely to give to religion than households with less education. This analysis suggests that there may be more to religious giving behavior than has been assumed in prior studies and underscores the need for further research into the motivation for religious giving. Specifically, these findings point to an enduring, internal motivation for giving rather than an external, ``What do I get for what I give,'' motive.},

The data also suggested that network size had a direct protective effect on mortality risk for both men and women, with men gaining protection at a lower level of network size than women.

  abstract = {This article investigates the data quality of ego-centered social network modules in web surveys. It specifically examines whether these modules are subject to the effects of the repeated measurement of the same questions known as panel conditioning effects. Ego-centered social network modules are especially at risk of panel conditioning effects because many of the components in these modules are repetitive. Based on the theories of motivated underreporting and survey satisficing, we hypothesized that respondents reduce the length of the module by underreporting their network size and/or network density. To systematically test for panel conditioning effects, we experimentally varied the treatment frequency in a longitudinal study design, which included three panel waves. The results of our study showed that we generally obtained high quality data with relatively large reported network sizes and densities, low rates of item non-response, and low non-differentiation. In contrast to our expectations, the reported average network sizes were not smaller, and the network densities were not lower when respondents were asked to answer the same social network module multiple times. We found, however, patterns of individual change in network sizes that might be due to panel conditioning. Respondents with large network sizes in a panel wave reported smaller network sizes in the subsequent wave, while respondents with small network sizes reported larger network sizes in the subsequent wave. Respondents' ability and motivation did not affect these results. Thus, we would like to encourage researchers to further explore the opportunity of implementing ego-centered social network modules in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal self-administered surveys, while being cautious that in longitudinal surveys the chance of panel conditioning effects may increase with the average network size and the response burden of the network module.},

Previous research has examined the influence on family history information of characteristics of the relative. In this report, the authors seek to clarify the impact on family history reporting of the psychiatric history of the informant. Method: Both members of female twin pairs fronz a population-based twin registry were asked about the history of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcoholism in their mother and father. The authors examined twin pairs discordant for each of the three diagnoses and predicted that the affected twin would report higher rates of the same disorder in her parent than would the unaffected twin. Results: Twins with a history of major depression or generalized anxiety disorder but not twins with alcoholism were significantly more likely to report the same disorder in their parents than were their unaffected co-twins. Conclusions: Por major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, a family history diagnosis appears to reflect the psychiatric history of both the relative and the informant. Caution may be needed in the interpretation of results based on the family history method, although the magnitude of this problem may be attenuated by the use of multiple infonnants.},

The findings offered strong support for the HEXACO approach: honesty\textendash humility significantly predicted nearly all of the religion outcomes, but the effects of agreeableness were significantly smaller and essentially zero. Honesty\textendash humility and agreeableness were not significantly related to the broader values and ideologies. Facet-level analyses suggested that the H-Fairness facet uniquely predicted higher religiosity, whereas the A-Patience facet tended to predict lower religiosity. Taken together, the findings strongly support the HEXACO analysis of religiosity and the broader value of distinguishing between honesty\textendash humility and agreeableness as interpersonal traits.},

Broadly speaking, we tried to review historical antecedents from the point of view of different disciplines, with specialists in each discipline preparing the basic text and co-authors helping to polish the material into a finished product. Briefly, we begin with an overview of the conceptual and philosophical foundations of our field of research. That is followed by a historical overview of the sociological roots of our field. In the third section, the main contributions from the discipline of economics are reviewed. The fourth section covers a historical overview of research on subjective well-being. Following that, the fourth section covers a historical overview of the literature on health-related quality of life is provided. Next, the history of QOL research from a marketing perspective is reviewed followed by a history from the perspectives of industrial/organizational psychology and management. Finally, we offer some forecasts for future QOL studies that are intended not only to predict what might happen, but to encourage, stimulate and motivate researchers to undertake new initiatives.},

Despite these accounts, relatively little material exists on the subject and the issue tends to be relegated to a footnote. This article ascertains the extent to which male sexual violence is committed in armed conflict. It considers factors that explain under-reporting by victims and lack of detection on the part of others. The particular forms of male sexual violence are also examined: namely rape, enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence, including enforced nudity, enforced masturbation and genital violence. The dynamics present in these offences are explored, with issues of power and dominance, expressed through emasculation, considered. Thus, attention is paid to ideas of feminization, homosexualization and the prevention of procreation. The symbolic construction of male and female bodies in armed conflict is also explored.},

  abstract = {The federal government created America's historic 1964 Civil Rights Act during a period of low immigration. The primary goal was to create equal opportunities for African Americans by ending Jim Crow discrimination in the South. Focusing on the issue of employment discrimination, and specifically employer preferences for immigrants, this article shows how the current period of high immigration from Latin America and Asia has created new challenges and dilemmas for Title VII, the employment discrimination title of the Civil Rights Act. Specifically, sociological evidence indicates that U.S. businesses are engaging in race-conscious employment focused on the perceived value of racial skills (special abilities of certain racial groups at particular jobs) and racial symbolism (organizational benefits from displaying certain races on the work force). Businesses hire Asians and Latinos, and especially immigrant Asians and Latinos, because of the perceived racial skills of these groups at low-status jobs that require strong work ethics and obedient attitudes. Corporate employers seeking skilled workers do not necessarily prefer immigrants. Instead, they seek minorities for the symbolic value of their diversity, for their general racial skills at bringing new ideas to the workplace, and for their racial marketing skills for growing non-White markets. I assess these developments from a legal perspective, showing that a combination of a lack of litigation and some key court decisions have prevented Title VII from regulating racial skills and racial symbolism and0or from offering protection for immigrants themselves.},

  abstract = {What role should racial difference play in the American workplace? As a nation, we rely on civil rights law to address this question, and the monumental Civil Rights Act of 1964 seemingly answered it: race must not be a factor in workplace decisions. In After Civil Rights , John Skrentny contends that after decades of mass immigration, many employers, Democratic and Republican political leaders, and advocates have adopted a new strategy to manage race and work. Race is now relevant not only in negative cases of discrimination, but in more positive ways as well. In today's workplace, employers routinely practice "racial realism," where they view race as real--as a job qualification. Many believe employee racial differences, and sometimes immigrant status, correspond to unique abilities or evoke desirable reactions from clients or citizens. They also see racial diversity as a way to increase workplace dynamism. The problem is that when employers see race as useful for organizational effectiveness, they are often in violation of civil rights law. After Civil Rights examines this emerging strategy in a wide range of employment situations, including the low-skilled sector, professional and white-collar jobs, and entertainment and media. In this important book, Skrentny urges us to acknowledge the racial realism already occurring, and lays out a series of reforms that, if enacted, would bring the law and lived experience more in line, yet still remain respectful of the need to protect the civil rights of all workers.},

This trend is largely explained by the clarity of party differences reducing indecision and ambivalence and increasing reliability in presidential voting. American National Election Studies (ANES) Times Series study data show that recent independent, less engaged voters perceive candidate differences as clearly as partisan, engaged voters of past elections and with declining rates of ambivalence, being undecided, and floating. Analysis of ANES inter-election panel studies shows the decline in switching is present among nonvoters too, as pure independents are as reliable in their party support as strong partisans of prior eras. These findings show parties benefit from the behavioral response of all Americans to polarization. By providing an ideological anchor to candidate evaluations, polarization produces a reliable base of party support that is less responsive to short-term forces.},

These three elements are analyzed by examining the relationship between industrial air pollution and the proportion of population in metropolitan areas that are conservative Protestant, Mainline Protestant, Catholic, and a composite measure. Results show that the composite measure is associated with more industrial pollution. But important distinctions between religious groups show that a greater proportion of conservative Protestant Evangelical adherents are associated with greater pollution, but that Catholic and Mainline Protestant adherents are not. These findings suggest the importance of renewing research between religion and environmental degradation.},

Because cohort membership can be defined by age at a particular period, the statistical partitioning of age from period and cohort effects focuses attention on identifying restrictions. When applying statistical models to social data, identification issues are ubiquitous, so some of the debates that vexed the formative literature on age?period? cohort models can now be understood in a larger context. Four new articles on age?period?cohort modeling call attention to the multilevel nature of the problem and draw on advances in methods including nonparametric smoothing, fixed and random effects, and identification in structural or causal models.},

Empirically, the standard scale used to measure Christian nationalism contains survey items that are too ambiguous to adequately inform (or constrain) interpretations of findings. The authors draw from cultural sociology and political science to highlight key questions current Christian nationalism scholarship does not adequately address. The authors present results from a latent class analysis to show how the same survey items allow other interpretations of how Americans think about religion, state, and public life.

  abstract = {The Big Five personality traits have been linked to dozens of life outcomes. However, metascientific research has raised questions about the replicability of behavioral science. The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication (LOOPR) Project was therefore conducted to estimate the replicability of the personality-outcome literature. Specifically, I conducted preregistered, high-powered (median N = 1,504) replications of 78 previously published trait\textendash outcome associations. Overall, 87\% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77\% as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication. These results indicate that the personality-outcome literature provides a reasonably accurate map of trait\textendash outcome associations but also that it stands to benefit from efforts to improve replicability.},

We review current knowledge about inequality and bias in the health care system, including the epidemiology of such patterns and their underlying mechanisms. Over the past three decades, we observe growth in our knowledge about provider cognitive and psychological processing, including the development of precision measuring tools to analyze provider bias, racial and otherwise. In the same timeframe we observe decreased emphasis on social, interactional, organizational, and structural factors that shape variation in medical treatment. We frame our discussion within a modified social ecological model and discuss tools for moving forward and reinvigorating sociological presence in this important research area.},

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the `hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Analysis of clergy responses revealed several prominent themes in the following areas: barriers to establishing supportive relationships, strategies for establishing and maintaining supportive relationships, lack of support, and coping with loneliness. Identified themes, as well as clergy responses that exemplified these themes, are discussed. Clergy with social support scores at or above the median more frequently indicated that being transparent and vulnerable is a means by which they establish and maintain close, supportive relationships with others.},

Negative interactions included abandonment by the church, equating mental illness with the work of demons, and suggesting that the mental disorder was the result of personal sin. Analysis of the data by gender found that women were significantly more likely than men to have their mental illness dismissed by the church and/or be told not to take psychiatric medication. Given that a religious support system can play a vital role in recovery from serious mental disorders, these results suggest that continued education is needed to bring the Christian and mental health communities together.},

Longitudinal network analysis of a three-wave panel study of 12- to 13-year-olds (N = 453) found that more prejudiced majority group members formed fewer intergroup friendships than less prejudiced majority group members. This was caused indirectly by the preference to become friends of one's friends' friends (triadic closure). More prejudiced majority members did not have a preference for actively avoiding minority group members. Rather, they had the tendency to avoid friends who already had minority group friends and thus could not be introduced to potential minority group friends. Instead they became friends with the majority group friends of their friends. This research shows how a social networks perspective can further our understanding of the processes underlying intergroup contact.},

Only subjects in normal sinus rhythm with {$\geq$}18 hours of usable data were included. Eligible subjects were 71 {$\pm$} 5 years. During 7 years of follow-up, 21.7\% had died. Hours were scored as normal (0), borderline (0.5), or abnormal (1) from a combination of plot appearance and HRV. Summed scores were normalized to 100\% to create an abnormality score (ABN). Short-term HRV versus each 5th percentile of ABN was plotted and a cutpoint for markedly increased HRV identified. The t-tests compared HRV for subjects above and below this cutpoint. Cox regression evaluated the association of ABN and mortality. Results: Of 5,815 eligible hourly plots, 64.4\% were normal, 14.5\% borderline, and 21.1\% abnormal. HR, SDNN, SDNNIDX, ln VLF and LF power, and power law slope did not differ by the cutpoint for increased short-term HRV, while SDANN and ln ULF power were significantly lower for those above the cutpoint. However, many HRV indices including LF/HF ratio and normalized LF and HF power were significantly different between groups (P {$<$} 0.001). Increased ABN was significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.019). Despite similar values for many HRV indices, being in the group above the cutpoint was significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.04). Conclusions: Abnormal HR patterns that elevate many HRV indices are prevalent among the elderly and associated with higher risk of mortality. Consideration of abnormal HRV may improve HRV-based risk stratification. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 16, pp. 954-959, September 2005)},

Early-life stressors, such as childhood abuse and early socioeconomic adversity, are linked to increased cardiovascular morbidity in adulthood. Our updated meta-analyses of prospective studies published until 2011 show a 1.5-fold (95\% confidence interval 1.2-1.9) increased risk of coronary heart disease among adults experiencing social isolation and a 1.3-fold (1.2-1.5) excess risk for workplace stress; adverse metabolic changes are one of the underlying plausible mechanisms. Stress, anger, and depressed mood can act as acute triggers of major cardiac events; the pooled relative risk of acute coronary syndrome onset being preceded by stress is 2.5 (1.8-3.5) in case-crossover studies. Stress is also implicated in the prognosis of cardiovascular disease and in the development of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. A major challenge over the next decade is to incorporate stress processes into the mainstream of cardiovascular pathophysiological research and understanding.},

The authors employ a principal theory in sociology on the self, identity theory, to theoretically frame this research, and they use a representative sample of individuals in newly forged relationships to examine the reciprocal relationship between resources and the verification of a person identity and role identity. The findings reveal that the relationship between resource use and identity verification is mutually reinforcing: resource use facilitates identity verification and identity verification increases the resources available for future use. This reciprocal relationship occurs across identities and over time. The results provide insights on the idea that resources at the macro-, meso-, and microlevels are mobilized among social actors to support the self and each other, help maintain a system of interaction, and reproduce culture and social structure.},

Methods We estimated trends between 1980 and 2008 in overweight and obesity prevalence and their uncertainty for adults 20 years of age and older in 199 countries and territories. Data were from a previous study, which used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean body mass index (BMI) based on published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiologic studies. Here, we used the estimated mean BMIs in a regression model to predict overweight and obesity prevalence by age, country, year, and sex. The uncertainty of the estimates included both those of the Bayesian hierarchical model and the uncertainty due to cross-walking from mean BMI to overweight and obesity prevalence. Results The global age-standardized prevalence of obesity nearly doubled from 6.4\% (95\% uncertainty interval 5.7-7.2\%) in 1980 to 12.0\% (11.5-12.5\%) in 2008. Half of this rise occurred in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000, and half occurred in the 8 years between 2000 and 2008. The age-standardized prevalence of overweight increased from 24.6\% (22.7-26.7\%) to 34.4\% (33.2-35.5\%) during the same 28-year period. In 2008, female obesity prevalence ranged from 1.4\% (0.7-2.2\%) in Bangladesh and 1.5\% (0.9-2.4\%) in Madagascar to 70.4\% (61.9-78.9\%) in Tonga and 74.8\% (66.7-82.1\%) in Nauru. Male obesity was below 1\% in Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ethiopia, and was highest in Cook Islands (60.1\%, 52.6-67.6\%) and Nauru (67.9\%, 60.5-75.0\%). Conclusions Globally, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased since 1980, and the increase has accelerated. Although obesity increased in most countries, levels and trends varied substantially. These data on trends in overweight and obesity may be used to set targets for obesity prevalence as requested at the United Nations high-level meeting on Prevention and Control of NCDs.},

  abstract = {What does land acknowledgment do? Where does it come from? Where is it pointing? Existing literature, especially critiques by Indigenous scholars, unequivocally assert that settler land acknowledgments are problematic in their favoring of rhetoric over action. However, formal written statements may challenge institutions to recognize their complicity in settler colonialism and their institutional responsibilities to tribal sovereignty. Building on these critiques, particularly the writings of M\'etis cultural producer Chelsea Vowel, this article offers beyond as a framework for how institutional land acknowledgments can or cannot support Indigenous relationality, land pedagogy, and accountability to place and peoples. The authors describe the critical differences between Indigenous protocols of mutual recognition and settler practices of land acknowledgment. These Indigenous/settler differences illuminate an Indigenous perspective on what acknowledgments ought to accomplish. For example, Acjachemen/Tongva scholar Charles Sepulveda forwards the Tongva concept of Kuuyam, or guest, as ``a reimagining of human relationships to place outside of the structures of settler colonialism.'' What would it mean for a settler speaker of a land acknowledgment to say, ``I am a visitor, and I hope to become a proper guest''? Two empirical examples are presented: the University of California, Los Angeles, where an acknowledgment was crafted in 2018; and the University of California, San Diego, where an acknowledgment is under way in 2020. The article concludes with beyond as a potential decolonial framework for land acknowledgment that recognizes Indigenous futures.},

A Duke University study found that eighty-five percent of seminary graduates entering the ministry leave within five years and 90 \% of all pastors will not stay to retirement (Kanipe, 2007, n.p.). This study also found that the North Georgia clergy attrition rate ran as high as 90 \% for those having served 20 years or more. These ministers apparently left to preserve what was left of their families, their sanity, their health and their faith (Kanipe). These statistics further indicate a poor professional prognosis for seminary students and highly suggest an urgent need for interventions. Less clear is what interventions can most positively impact the professional experience of ministers and result in success in their chosen profession. One area to explore, however, is management skill training for all seminary students in relation to the dropout rate and termination of senior ministers. Terminations and Dropout Rates Various researchers have noted the crisis facing ministry in the United States. Ministry as a profession is in jeopardy. According to studies by the Alban Institute and Fuller Seminary, 50 \% of ministers drop out of ministry within the first five years and many never to go back to church again (Meek et al., 2003,},

  abstract = {For readers of Democracy in Chains and Dark Money, a revelatory investigation of the Religious Right's rise to political power. For too long the Religious Right has masqueraded as a social movement preoccupied with a number of cultural issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage. In her deeply reported investigation, Katherine Stewart reveals a disturbing truth: this is a political movement that seeks to gain power and to impose its vision on all of society. America's religious nationalists aren't just fighting a culture war, they are waging a political war on the norms and institutions of American democracy.Stewart pulls back the curtain on the inner workings and leading personalities of a movement that has turned religion into a tool for domination. She exposes a dense network of think tanks, advocacy groups, and pastoral organizations embedded in a rapidly expanding community of international alliances and united not by any central command but by a shared, anti-democratic vision and a common will to power. She follows the money that fuels this movement, tracing much of it to a cadre of super-wealthy, ultraconservative donors and family foundations. She shows that today's Christian nationalism is the fruit of a longstanding antidemocratic, reactionary strain of American thought that draws on some of the most troubling episodes in America's past. It forms common cause with a globe-spanning movement that seeks to destroy liberal democracy and replace it with nationalist, theocratic and autocratic forms of government around the world. Religious nationalism is far more organized and better funded than most people realize. It seeks to control all aspects of government and society. Its successes have been stunning, and its influence now extends to every aspect of American life, from the White House to state capitols, from our schools to our hospitals. The Power Worshippers is a brilliantly reported book of warning and a wake-up call. Stewart's probing examination demands that Christian nationalism be taken seriously as a significant threat to the American republic and our democratic freedoms.},

The bulk of the work has been conducted in the first three areas and deals with turnover of both personnel and jobs; growth, decline and stability; opportunity structures; and performance and policy. As for the latter, there are new insights into innovation and adaptation; cohort conflict and competition; labor costs and labor cuts; and EEO and Affirmative Action, particularly sex segregation. Here, only one of the four areas, intraorganizational demography, is extensively covered, with the other three areas briefly reviewed. Overall, the potential for organizational demography appears great, especially for yielding new insights into organizational behavior. There are also current linkages with internal labor market theory, and linkages with ecological and network theories are beginning to emerge. New implications for stratification theory and national opportunity structures, the dynamics of labor markets, and for research in aging are also indicated. From this review, we conclude that there is much to be gained from theoretical development at the interface of organizations and demography.},

Predictors of overweight are described by means of various studies undertaken in SSA, and dietary intakes of numerous countries are presented. Overall, we show that socioeconomic status, gender, age, parity, physical inactivity, and increased energy, fat, and sugar intake are powerful predictors of overweight and/or obesity. The urgency for health interventions in countries in the early stages of the nutrition transition is emphasized, particularly in view of the fact that fat intake is still less than 30\% of energy intake in nearly all Sub-Saharan African countries.},

How such involvement increases survival are unclear. To test the hypothesis that religious attendance might serve to improve and maintain good health behaviors, mental health, and social relationships, changes and consistencies in these variables were studied between 1965 and 1994 for 2,676 Alameda County Study participants, from 17 to 65 years of age in 1965, who survived to 1994. Measures included smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, medical checkups, depression, social interactions, and marital status. Those reporting weekly religious attendance in 1965 were more likely to both improve poor health behaviors and maintain good ones by 1994 than were those whose attendance was less or none. Weekly attendance was also associated with improving and maintaining good mental health, increased social relationships, and marital stability. Results were stronger for women in improving poor health behaviors and mental health, consistent with known gender differences in associations between religious attendance and survival. Further understanding the mechanisms involved could aid health promotion and intervention efforts.},

Participants in the YIPS condition experienced greater negative affect and less positive affect than did those in the control condition. Further, restrained eaters ate more following the YIPS than did nonrestrained eaters. In Experiment 2, 25 male and female undergraduates completed the YIPS. The YIPS induced significant increases in tension, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline, while significantly decreasing positive affect. The YIPS appeared particularly relevant for women, resulting in significantly greater increases in cortisol and SBP for women compared to men.

  abstract = {At one of the largest Catholic churches in America, hundreds of people make their way into the spacious, well-appointed sanctuary for an evening Mass. The congregation is several times larger than most Protestant megachurches. In addition to its twenty weekly services, eight choirs, and elementary and middle schools, the church also administers a long roster of Bible studies, home groups, community outreach, and specialized programs for every conceivable class and group of persons. The sermon is delivered by the pastor and celebrant priest who, at one point, refers to his struggle to relate to his teenage daughter. No one is surprised, for the long-time leader of this prominent Catholic Church, in a conservative suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, is a married Catholic priest. Following the Episcopal Church's 1976 decision to ordain women, Catholic leaders in America and Rome were approached by Episcopal clergy who opposed the decision and sought conversion as a result. The Catholics responded by establishing rules that would allow the Church to receive married convert priests as exceptions to the rule of celibacy-a decree known as the Pastoral Provision. In this fascinating book, D. Paul Sullins brings to light the untold stories of these curious creatures: married Catholic priests. Sullins explores their day-to-day lives, their journey to Catholicism, and their views on issues important to the Church. Surprisingly, he reveals, married Catholic priests are more conservative than their celibate colleagues on nearly every issue, including celibacy: they think that priests should, in general, not be allowed to marry. Drawing on over 115 interviews with priests and their wives, as well as unprecedented access to the U.S. records of the Pastoral Provision, Keeping the Vow offers the first comprehensive look at these families and their unusual and difficult journey from Anglicanism to Catholicism. Looking to the future, Sullins speculates on what the experiences of these priests might tell us about the future of priestly celibacy.},

  abstract = {Background There is limited knowledge of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) among high risk populations, especially in the developing countries. We report our study of testing for CKD in at-risk subjects. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 527 people from primary and secondary health care areas in the city of Kinshasa were studied from a random sample of at-risk out-patients with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or HIV+. We measured blood pressure (BP), blood glucose level, proteinuria, body mass index, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR by MDRD equation) using calibrated creatinine levels based on one random measurement. The associations between health characteristics, indicators of kidney damage (proteinuria) and kidney function ({$<$}60 ml/min/1.73 m2) were also examined. Results The prevalence of CKD in this study was 36\%, but only 12\% were aware of their condition. 4\% of patients had stage 1 CKD, 6\% stage 2, 18\% stage 3, 2\% stage 4, and 6\% had stage 5. 24 hour quantitative proteinuria ({$>$}300 mg/day) was found in 19\%. In those with the at-risk conditions, the \% of CKD was: 44\% in patients with hypertension, 39\% in those with diabetes; 16\% in the obese and 12\% in those who were HIV+. 82\% of those with a history of diabetes had elevated serum glucose levels at screening ({$\geq$} 126 mg/dl). Only 6\% of individuals with hypertension having CKD had reduced BP to lower than 130/80 mmHg. In multivariate analysis, diabetes, proteinuria and hypertension were the strongest determinants of CKD 3+. Conclusion It appears that one out of three people in this at-risk population has undiagnosed CKD and poorly controlled CKD risk factors. This growing problem poses clear challenges to this developing country. Therefore, CKD should be addressed through the development of multidisciplinary teams and improved communication between traditional health care givers and nephrology services. Attention to CKD risk factors must become a priority.},

  abstract = {Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the risk factors associated with CKD in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 503 adult residents in 10 of the 35 health zones of Kinshasa were studied in a randomly selected sample. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation (eGFR) and compared with the Cockcroft\textendash Gault equation for creatinine clearance. The associations between health characteristics, indicators of kidney damage (proteinuria) and kidney function ({$<$}60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) were examined. Results: The prevalence of all stages of CKD according to K/DOQI guidelines was 12.4\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 11.0\textendash 15.1\%]. By stage, 2\% had stage 1 (proteinuria with normal eGFR), 2.4\% had stage 2 (proteinuria with an eGFR of 60\textendash 89 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ), 7.8\% had stage 3 (eGFR, 30\textendash 59 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and 0.2\% had stage 5 (eGFR {$<$} 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ). Hypertension and age were independently associated with CKD stage 3. The prevalences of major non-communicable diseases considered in this study were 27.6\% (95\% CI, 25.7\textendash 31.3\%) for hypertension, 11.7\% (95\% CI, 10.3\textendash 14.4\%) for diabetes mellitus and 14.9\% (95\% CI, 13.3\textendash 17.9\%) for obesity. Hypertension was also independently associated with proteinuria. Conclusion: More than 10\% of the Kinshasa population exhibits signs of CKD, which is affecting adults in their productive years. Risk factors for CKD, including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, are increasing. These alarming data must guide current and future healthcare policies to meet the challenge raised by CKD in this city and hopefully in the whole country.},

Current study estimated the rate of depressive disorder and identified the correlates of depressive disorder among PLWH in China. Methods: 258 PLWH in China were recruited and interviewed with a structured questionnaire including measurements testing perceived stress, social support, perceived discrimination, and depression. Mediating effect of perceived stress between perceived discrimination and depression and moderating effect of social support on effect of perceived discrimination and perceived stress to depression were tested. Multivariate regression was used to examine the determinants of depression. Results: The prevalence of mild to severe depression is 71.9\%. The relationship between the perceived discrimination and depression is fully mediated by perceived stress (perceived discrimination that was statistically significant (b {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.153) to depression became non-significant after adding perceived stress in the regression model). Interaction term between social support and perceived stress has negative effects (b{$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A 0.117) and explained a significant amount of variance (R2{$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.018) in depression. Lower income, and higher perceived stress predicted more depressive symptoms. Limitations: Cross-sectional study and self-report bias are major limitations of this study. Conclusion: Depression among PLWH is a severe problem in China. Primary health care workers need to be trained in recognition and treatment in depression. Stress management skills and social support for PLWH are warranted.},

  abstract = {Mothers in the United States use a combination of employment, public transfers, and private safety nets to cushion the economic losses of romantic union dissolution, but changes in maternal labor force participation, government transfer programs, and private social networks may have altered the economic impact of union dissolution over time. Using nationally representative panels from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from 1984 to 2007, we show that the economic consequences of divorce have declined since the 1980s owing to the growth in married women's earnings and their receipt of child support and income from personal networks. In contrast, the economic consequences of cohabitation dissolution were modest in the 1980s but have worsened over time. Cohabiting mothers' income losses associated with union dissolution now closely resemble those of divorced mothers. These trends imply that changes in marital stability have not contributed to rising income instability among families with children, but trends in the extent and economic costs of cohabitation have likely contributed to rising income instability for less-advantaged children.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives In developing countries, caring for the large number of babies in orphanages is very hard work.Whereas the physical needs of most of the children are met, play often gets neglected. Studies have repeatedly shown that babies in such institutionalized settings suffer from severe psychomotor retardation.The aim of this project was to develop an intervention programme of structured play.We hypothesized that such an intervention would result in acceleration of psychosocial development in otherwise healthy institutionalized children. Design Prospective longitudinal. Setting Mother Teresa's Orphanage, run by Missionaries of Charity. Subject and methods All 30 children in the orphanage aged 6 months\textendash 2.5 years, were assessed for their Motor, Mental and Social Quotients, using the Indian adaptation of Bailey's Scale of Infant Development(DASII) and the Vineland's Social Maturity Scale. A structured `Regime of Play' was then built into the routine of the orphanage. A repeat developmental assessment was performed at the end of 3 months to assess the impact. Results Out of the original cohort of 30, 19 children were available for post-intervention assessments.The remainder were adopted before their assessments.Their mean Motor Quotient rose from 63.7 to 81.7, mean Mental Quotient rose from 65.8 to 89.6 and the mean Social Quotient rose from 61.9 to 91.3, a gain of 18, 23 and 30 points respectively (p {$<$} 0.0001).There was also an overall change in the environment of the orphanage. Children became more active, playful, responsive and independent. Contrary to what caretakers assumed, their workload actually decreased.The responsiveness in the children awakened as a result of play, acted as a positive feedback for caretakers to continue the play sessions. Conclusions This study shows that short daily sessions of play can significantly improve the development of children in such institutions. It is vital to remember that children grow `Not by Bread Alone'.},

However, both have generally failed to examine what is perhaps one of the most detrimental and psychologically traumatic experiences a minister may have associated with ministry work: forced termination. Forced termination should be considered an under-studied area of research and should be distinguished from choosing to leave the ministry or being fired from a ministry post. Forced termination is both the process and result of psychological, emotional, social, and spiritual abuse directed toward paid and non-paid ministry leaders by members of a congregation or denominational leaders, such that there is no other option for the minister but to leave the post. This qualitative study used a grounded theory approach to describe the experience of forced termination of couples where at least one individual is a vocational minister. Twenty-one couples agreed to participate in the study, and 14 were interviewed. The data of four couples are presented as representative of the saturated data from all 14 couples. Four important themes or stages the couples experienced emerged from the study: honeymoon, betrayal, harassment, and leaving the church.},

The present paper first reviews the evidence in favour of the three most influential of these (Leiter and Maslach's model (1988); Golembiewski, Boudreau, Munzenrider, \& Luo's (1996) phase model; and Lee and Ashforth's model (1993)). These three models, and our own model (which integrates of two of them, and includes feedback effects of depersonalization on emotional exhaustion) are then compared with each other using structural equation modelling, drawing on longitudinal data from two Dutch samples (total N 0/1185). The review revealed that none of the seven previous studies on this issue provided any convincing support for any particular causal order proposed so far. In contrast, our own study showed that high levels of exhaustion were associated with high levels of depersonalization over time across both samples. Further, higher levels of depersonalization led to higher levels of emotional exhaustion and lower levels of personal accomplishment. To our knowledge, the present research is the first to provide reliable longitudinal evidence for the conceptualization of burnout as a developmental process, although the effects are not large enough to be of practical use in the recognition of burnout.},

  abstract = {To summarize, traditional conceptions of mental health assert that well-adjusted individuals possess relatively accurate perceptions of themselves, their capacity to control important events in their lives, and their future. In contrast to this portrayal, a great deal of research in social, personality, clinical, and developmental psychology documents that normal individuals possess unrealistically positive views of themselves, an exaggerated belief in their ability to control their environment, and a view of the future that maintains that their future will be far better than the average person's. Furthermore, individuals who are moderately depressed or low in self-esteem consistently display an absence of such enhancing illusions. Together, these findings appear inconsistent with the notion that accurate selfknowledge is the hallmark of mental health.},

  abstract = {Background: Social network characteristics have long been associated with mental health, but their longitudinal impact on depression is less known. We determined whether quality of social relationships and social isolation predicts the development of depression. Methods: The sample consisted of a cohort of 4,642 American adults age 25\textendash 75 who completed surveys at baseline in 1995\textendash 1996 and at ten-year follow-up. Quality of relationships was assessed with non-overlapping scales of social support and social strain and a summary measure of relationship quality. Social isolation was measured by presence of a partner and reported frequency of social contact. The primary outcome was past year major depressive episode at ten-year follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted, adjusting for the presence of potential confounders. Results: Risk of depression was significantly greater among those with baseline social strain (OR, 1.99; 95\% CI, 1.47\textendash 2.70), lack of social support (OR, 1.79; 95\% CI, 1.37\textendash 2.35), and poor overall relationship quality (OR 2.60; 95\% CI, 1.84\textendash 3.69). Those with the lowest overall quality of social relationships had more than double the risk of depression (14.0\%; 95\% CI, 12.0\textendash 16.0; p,.001) than those with the highest quality (6.7\%; 95\% CI, 5.3\textendash 8.1; p,.001). Poor quality of relationship with spouse/ partner and family each independently increased risk of depression. Social isolation did not predict future depression, nor did it moderate the effect of relationship quality. Conclusions: Quality of social relationships is a major risk factor for major depression. Depression interventions should consider targeting individuals with low quality of social relationships.},

To date however, dietary assessment studies that have assessed how biodiversity actually contributes to human diets are virtually absent. This study measured the contribution of wild edible plants (WEP) to the dietary quality in the high biodiverse context of DR Congo. The habitual dietary intake was estimated from 2 multiple-pass 24 h dietary recalls for 363 urban and 129 rural women. All WEP were collected during previous ethnobotanical investigations and identified and deposited in the National Botanical Garden of Belgium (BR). Results showed that in a high biodiverse region with precarious food security, WEP are insufficiently consumed to increase nutrition security or dietary adequacy. The highest contribution came from Dacryodes edulis in the village sample contributing 4.8\% of total energy intake. Considering the nutrient composition of the many WEP available in the region and known by the indigenous populations, the potential to increase nutrition security is vast. Additional research regarding the dietary contribution of agricultural biodiversity and the nutrient composition of WEP would allow to integrate them into appropriate dietary guidelines for the region and pave the way to domesticate the most interesting WEP.},

A clergy member unable to cope with challenges in his or her own life may be ineffective at helping church members to cope with their stress. In the present study, we developed and tested an operational model of clergy holistic health, including occupational demands, and personal and job-related resources. Data were collected from clergy (N\,=\,418) and analyzed using correlational and regression-based techniques. Results from the present study provide support for the demands-control-support model (Johnson and Hall in Am J Public Health 78(10):1336\textendash 1342, 1988). Specifically, our findings suggest that clergy mental health may be improved by (a) an increase in the work-related social support needed to take advantage of job control followed by (b) an increase in job control. Furthermore, the present findings expand on previous research by identifying spiritual well-being as an important outcome that may be impacted by job-related demands. The present findings also underscore the value of contextualized or occupation-specific measures, given the stronger correlations that were observed between the occupation-specific measure of perceived job demands than the general measure of perceived job demands.},

Using k-means clustering, the article aims to build a typology of clergy members' work orientation and analyze wellbeing at work among different types of clergy members. The study is based on a survey conducted in 2014 among the clergy in the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland (N = 562). The results of the study show that the clergy have clear and distinctive work orientation profiles and that these profiles also have a clear linkage to wellbeing at work. Four clergy profiles were identified: clergy with a multifaceted orientation (47 \%); clergy oriented towards worship life (29 \%); clergy oriented towards promoting justice and helping (19 \%); and clergy with a passive orientation (6 \%). The study strongly suggests that clergy members with the broadest orientation and interests are most able to deal with the multifaceted demands of church work. A multiple orientation seemed to serve as a strong supporting factor at work, and by being oriented to a broad range of activities, this group also enjoyed more potential sources of support and more joyful experiences at work. Those oriented towards worship life drew their main support from the spiritual aspects of work, but they were most likely to suffer from a lack of social competence. Those oriented toward promoting justice and helping received most support from encountering people. At the same time those who were passively oriented in their work experienced the least satisfaction and the least support.},

We find that measurement differences are often negligible when asking about extremely close relationships like friendship. However, differences often appear when studying ``weak tie'' types of relationships such as recognition of classmate names or acquaintances.},

  abstract = {The intimate connection between the brain and the heart was enunciated by Claude Bernard over 150 years ago. In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model and update it with recent results. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis of recent neuroimaging studies on the relationship between heart rate variability and regional cerebral blood flow. We identified a number of regions, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in which significant associations across studies were found. We further propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. Heart rate variability may provide an index of how strongly `top\textendash down' appraisals, mediated by cortical-subcortical pathways, shape brainstem activity and autonomic responses in the body. If the default response to uncertainty is the threat response, as we propose here, contextual information represented in `appraisal' systems may be necessary to overcome this bias during daily life. Thus, HRV may serve as a proxy for `vertical integration' of the brain mechanisms that guide flexible control over behavior with peripheral physiology, and as such provides an important window into understanding stress and health. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The understanding of the risk factors for CVD may yield important insights into the prevention, etiology, course, and treatment of this major public health concern. Autonomic imbalance, characterized by a hyperactive sympathetic system and a hypoactive parasympathetic system, is associated with various pathological conditions. Over time, excessive energy demands on the system can lead to premature aging and diseases. Therefore, autonomic imbalance may be a final common pathway to increased morbidity and mortality from a host of conditions and diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) may be used to assess autonomic imbalances, diseases and mortality. Parasympathetic activity and HRV have been associated with a wide range of conditions including CVD. Here we review the evidence linking HRV to established and emerging modifiable and non-modifiable CVD risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, family history and work stress. Substantial evidence exists to support the notion that decreased HRV precedes the development of a number of risk factors and that lowering risk profiles is associated with increased HRV. We close with a suggestion that a model of autonomic imbalance may provide a unifying framework within which to investigate the impact of risk factors, including psychosocial factors and work stress, on cardiovascular disease.},

Stress-buffering processes also involve these mechanisms. I argue that there are two broad types of support, emotional sustenance and active coping assistance, and two broad categories of supporters, significant others and experientially similar others, who specialize in supplying different types of support to distressed individuals. Emotionally sustaining behaviors and instrumental aid from significant others and empathy, active coping assistance, and role modeling from similar others should be most efficacious in alleviating the physical and emotional impacts of stressors.},

  abstract = {The DSM-5 classification of performance anxiety as distinct from social anxiety underlines the need for specific measurement instruments. The Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) are widely used assessments of performance and general interaction anxiety, yet few studies have examined their criterion validity using actual performance and interaction stressors. The current study is the first to assess the scales' convergent and discriminant validity using multimodal anxiety indices including psychophysiological reactivity, which is a key characterizing feature of performance anxiety. Ninety-three individuals completed the SPS and SIAS and participated in performance and interaction challenges. Anxiety response was assessed with criterion measures of self-reported anxiety, observer-rated anxiety, heart rate and skin conductance. Both scales were moderately correlated with self-report and observer-rated anxiety (r's\,=\,0.21\textendash 0.62) and weakly correlated with physiological measures (r's\,=\,0.07\textendash 0.35), generally supporting convergent criterion validity. Discriminant criterion validity was not supported, however, with the SIAS and SPS showing similar correlations with each criterion measure for both social challenges. These findings suggest the SIAS and SPS are valid instruments for the assessment of social anxiety but may not be suitable for the specific measurement of performance and interaction anxiety.},

Methods of cross-survey analysis and small area estimation, however, can be used to provide reliable estimates of such lowincidence groups. To illustrate these methods, data from 50 national surveys are combined to examine the Jewish population in the United States. Hierarchical models are used to examine clustering of respondents within surveys and geographic regions. Bayesian analyses with Monte Carlo simulations are used to obtain pooled, state-level estimates poststratified by sex, race, education, and age to obtain certainty intervals about the estimates. This cross-survey approach provides a useful and practical analytic framework that can be generalized both to more extensive study of religion in the United States and to other social science problems in which single data sources are insufficient for reliable statistical inference.},

How, he asks, do long-lasting, systematic inequalities in life chances arise, and how do they come to distinguish members of different socially defined categories of persons? Exploring representative paired and unequal categories, such as male/female, black/white, and citizen/noncitizen, Tilly argues that the basic causes of these and similar inequalities greatly resemble one another. In contrast to contemporary analyses that explain inequality case by case, this account is one of process. Categorical distinctions arise, Tilly says, because they offer a solution to pressing organizational problems. Whatever the "organization" is\textemdash as small as a household or as large as a government\textemdash the resulting relationship of inequality persists because parties on both sides of the categorical divide come to depend on that solution, despite its drawbacks. Tilly illustrates the social mechanisms that create and maintain paired and unequal categories with a rich variety of cases, mapping out fertile territories for future relational study of durable inequality.},

Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and traditional beliefs have similarities and differences in their viewpoints. Improved understanding by health-care providers of the heterogeneity of viewpoints, both within and between faiths, and their effect on health care is important for clinical medicine, public-health programmes, and health-care policy. Increased appreciation in faith leaders of the effect of their teachings on health care is also crucial. This Series paper outlines some faith-related controversies, describes how they influence health-care provision and uptake, and identifies opportunities for research and increased interaction between faith leaders and health-care providers to improve health care.},

The predictive effect of exhaustion on burnout dimensions eight years later was also investigated. The longitudinal models were then tested in two occupational subgroups. The participants were 713 Finnish employees (415 white-collar and 298 blue-collar workers) from an international industry enterprise. The best fitting model of the associations between the three burnout dimensions was obtained by a path model where exhaustion predicted cynicism, and cynicism in turn predicted lack of professional efficacy. The symptoms of exhaustion were persistent over time. There were no differences between the two occupational groups in the process of burnout. Also the work-related antecedents of burnout (job stressors) were very similar in both groups. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The model that directly estimates RR or PR and correctly specifies the distribution of the outcome as binomial is the log-binomial model, however, convergence problems occur very often. Robust Poisson regression also estimates these measures but it can produce probabilities greater than 1. Results: In this paper, the use of Bayesian approach to solve the problem of convergence of the log-binomial model is illustrated. Furthermore, the method is extended to incorporate dependent data, as in cluster clinical trials and studies with multilevel design, and also to analyse polytomous outcomes. Comparisons between methods are made by analysing four data sets. Conclusions: In all cases analysed, it was observed that Bayesian methods are capable of estimating the measures of interest, always within the correct parametric space of probabilities.},

More specifically, we suggest: (1) that anti-black stereotypes may be subtler, more pervasive, and more functionally necessary than Emerson and Smith assume; and (2) that the individualistic ideals Emerson and Smith focus on are not race neutral but, instead, are part of a taken-for-granted and vigorously defended majority white culture and identity. These points are developed through a theoretical reconstruction of Emerson and Smith's argument and a reevaluation of their methodological approach and data. Finally, we present data from a recent national survey of race and religion in American life that provide preliminary quantitative support for our revisionist claims.},

  abstract = {Aim: This study aimed to compare the religiosity and religious coping of patients with schizophrenia with a healthy control group and to assess the correlation between the level of religiosity and religious coping with residual psychopathology, level of functioning, and quality of life (QOL). Methodology: Patients of schizophrenia were assessed on religiousness measure scale, duke religion index (DUREL), brief religious coping scale (RCOPE), positive and negative symptom scale, and World Health Organization QOL-BREF version. Results: Of the 100 patients of schizophrenia, 99\% reported that they believed in God. About 60\% of patients attended religious places either once a week or more and 56\% of patients indulged in private religious activity at least once a day. Two-third of the participants had high intrinsic religiosity score. The mean score of positive religious coping (PRC) subscale was 14.56 and that for negative religious coping (NRC) subscale was 8.31. No significant difference was noted in the various domains of religious measure scale, DUREL, and PRC between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. However, compared to healthy controls, patients more often used NRC. Various aspects of religiosity (except for negative RCOPE score) correlated negatively with residual psychopathology and positively with functioning and QOL. Conclusion: Findings of this study suggest that high proportions of patients with schizophrenia are religious and this is similar to healthy controls in the community. Higher level of religiosity and more frequent use of religious coping are associated with lower level of psychopathology and better QOL.},

College students ( N = 192) completed measures of awareness of negative consequences (AC), Christian orthodoxy, and environmental behavior. Results showed that Christian orthodoxy negatively related to all measures of environmental behavior. Additionally, biospheric AC was a complete mediator in Christian orthodoxy's relationships with environmental intentions and willingness to pay for environmental protection and was a partial mediator in Christian orthodoxy's relationship with proenvironmental political behavior. Neither egoistic AC nor social-altruistic AC correlated with Christian orthodoxy, so their mediating properties were not assessed. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {While communicable diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, malaria, and tuberculosis have continued to pose greater threats to the public health system in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is now apparent that non-communicable diseases such as diabetes mellitus are undoubtedly adding to the multiple burdens the peoples in this region suffer. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes (90\textendash 95\%), exhibiting an alarming prevalence among peoples of this region. Its main risk factors include obesity, rapid urbanization, physical inactivity, ageing, nutrition transitions, and socioeconomic changes. Patients in sub-Saharan Africa also show manifestations of {$\beta$}-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. However, because of strained economic resources and a poor health care system, most of the patients are diagnosed only after they have overt symptoms and complications. Microvascular complications are the most prevalent, but metabolic disorders and acute infections cause significant mortality. The high cost of treatment of T2DM and its comorbidities, the increasing prevalence of its risk factors, and the gaps in health care system necessitate that solutions be planned and implemented urgently. Aggressive actions and positive responses from well-informed governments appear to be needed for the conducive interplay of all forces required to curb the threat of T2DM in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the varied ethnic and transitional factors and the limited population data on T2DM in sub-Saharan Africa, this review provides an extensive discussion of the literature on the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, complications, treatment, and care challenges of T2DM in this region.},

There were no socioeconomic status effects and no differences between White and Black samples. However, Hispanic samples scored significantly higher on the CDI.

  abstract = {Previous research found declines in Americans' religious affiliation but few changes in religious beliefs and practices. By 2014, however, markedly fewer Americans participated in religious activities or embraced religious beliefs, with especially striking declines between 2006 and 2014 and among 18- to 29-year-olds in data from the nationally representative General Social Survey (N = 58,893, 1972-2014). In recent years, fewer Americans prayed, believed in God, took the Bible literally, attended religious services, identified as religious, affiliated with a religion, or had confidence in religious institutions. Only slightly more identified as spiritual since 1998, and then only those above age 30. Nearly a third of Millennials were secular not merely in religious affiliation but also in belief in God, religiosity, and religious service attendance, many more than Boomers and Generation X'ers at the same age. Eight times more 18- to 29-year-olds never prayed in 2014 versus the early 1980s. However, Americans have become slightly more likely to believe in an afterlife. In hierarchical linear modeling analyses, the decline in religious commitment was primarily due to time period rather than generation/birth cohort, with the decline in public religious practice larger (d = -.50) and beginning sooner (early 1990s) than the smaller (d = -.18) decline in private religious practice and belief (primarily after 2006). Differences in religious commitment due to gender, race, education, and region grew larger, suggesting a more religiously polarized nation.},

In this article, I argue for a life-span perspective on social support and health that takes into account distinct antecedent processes and mechanisms that are related to measures of support over time. Such a view highlights the need to distinguish measures of perceived and received support and its links to more specific diseases (e.g., chronic, acute) and stages of disease development (e.g., incidence). I discuss both the novel implications of these theoretical arguments for research on social support and physical health, as well as the potential intervention approaches that are apparent from this perspective.},

  abstract = {Parental divorce has been linked to religious outcomes in adulthood. Previous research, however, has not adequately accounted for parental religious characteristics, which may render the association spurious and/or moderate the relationship. Many studies also do not consider subsequent family context, namely, whether one's custodial parent remarries. Using pooled data from three waves of the General Social Survey, we examine the nature of the relationships among parental divorce, subsequent family structure, and religiosity in adulthood. Growing up in a single-parent family\textemdash but not a stepparent family\textemdash is positively associated with religious disaffiliation and religious switching and negatively associated with regular religious service attendance. Accounting for parental religious characteristics, however, explains sizable proportions of these relationships. In fact, after accounting for parental religious affiliation and service attendance, growing up with a single parent does not have a significant effect on religious service attendance. Parental religiosity also moderates the relationship between growing up with a single parent and religious service attendance: being raised in a single-parent home does have a negative effect on religious service attendance among adults who had two religiously involved parents. There is modest evidence of this moderating relationship for other religious outcomes. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

A theoretical model of social integration and social control is developed to explain why this may occur. Drawing from this model, I hypothesize that marriage may be beneficial to health because many spouses monitor and attempt to control their spouse's health behaviors. Furthermore, the provision, receipt, and consequences of these social control efforts may vary for men and women. These hypotheses are considered with analysis of a national panel survey conducted in 1986 (N = 3617) and 1989 (N = 2867). Results show that: (1) marriage is associated with receipt of substantially more efforts to control health for men than women, (2) those who attempt to control the health of others are more likely to be female than male, (3) there is some support for the social control and health behavior hypothesis among the married, and (4) the transition from married to unmarried status is associated with an increase in negative health behavior while the transition from unmarried to married status seems to have little effect on health behavior. A theoretical explanation is developed to explain these marital status differences.},

Support for competing theories concerning political ideology, religious practice, and charitable financial giving is assessed using data from the Panel Study on American Ethnicity and Religion (PS-ARE). For both religious and nonreligious giving, the effect of political ideology is completely mediated by participation in religious and civic practices. These findings support recent arguments on ``practice theory'' in cultural sociology and suggest that it is less the effect of ideology than of active participation in religious, political, and community organizations that explains Americans' financial giving to religious and nonreligious organizations.},

Obesity is associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The current treatment paradigm emphasizes lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise; however this approach produces only modest weight loss for many patients. When lifestyle modifications fail, the current ``gold standard'' therapy for obesity is bariatric surgery, including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, duodenal switch, and placement of an adjustable gastric band. Though effective, bariatric surgery can have severe short- and long-term complications. To fill the major gap in invasiveness between lifestyle modification and surgery, researchers have been developing pharmacotherapies and minimally invasive endoscopic techniques to treat obesity. Recently, interventional radiologists developed a percutaneous transarterial catheter-directed therapy targeting the hormonal function of the stomach. This review describes the current standard obesity treatments (including diet, exercise, and surgery), as well as newer endoscopic bariatric procedures and pharmacotherapies to help patients lose weight. We present data from two ongoing human trials of a new interventional radiology procedure for weight loss, bariatric embolization.},

Distinguishing between these two individual-level process\textemdash a settled dispositions model and an active updating model\textemdash is important because these individual-level processes underlie different theories of population-level social change. This article introduces an alternative method for adjudicating between these two models based on structural equation modeling. This model provides a close fit to the theoretical models outlined in previous work. Applying this method to more than 500 questions in the General Social Survey's three-wave panels, we find even stronger evidence than previous work that most survey responses reflect settled dispositions developed prior to adulthood.},

Recent research suggests that the emergence of such self-transcendence can be facilitated by specific uplifting emotions termed self-transcendent positive emotions (STPEs); STPEs are short, positive responses to witnessing instances of beauty or good outside the self. The author reviews the defining characteristics of STPEs and the related current empirical research in psychology. Next, still building upon research in psychology, she examines how they are intertwined with spirituality and religion (beliefs and practices) and serve important functions when experienced in a religious context. The emerging biblical research on how positive emotions are constructed in the Hebrew Bible and in the New Testament is the studied, and how the religious context may modify the interpretation and phenomenological experience of positive emotions is discussed. Future avenues for research include the study of the specific emotion of joy and a better consideration of emotion's embodiment.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between gender and social support. It was found that men were more isolated than women although there were no gender differences in perceived adequacy (i.e., satisfaction with one's social support network) or network size. Given that both the adequacy and network size variables were associated with socially desirable responding but the isolation variable was not, the results suggest that the behaviorally oriented indicator of isolation was a better measure of the degree of social isolation than traditional subjective scales currently used by many researchers. This suggests that traditional measures of social support that incorporate the dimensions of network size and perceived adequacy of one's social support system need to control for socially desirable responding and that measures can and need to be developed that are not significantly influenced by this response set bias. Hence, the assessment of social support may need to be more multifaceted than is currently undertaken in many studies. Our finding that men reported being more isolated than women may be a function, in part, of the fact that the majority of the sample (76.7\%) was single/did not live with a partner. Previous research has found that men generally get their emotional needs met by their spouses/partners while women often get their emotional needs met by their female friends. Consistent with the literature, and given that most of our respondents were single, this study supports the contention that men are generally more socially isolated than women because they do not create adequate emotional intimacy when they are not in partnership with a significant other.},

We have shared the initial results and drafts with international specialists in the context of hypertension in Africa and incorporated their feedback. Hypertension is the number one risk factor for CVD in Africa. Consequently, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has taken over as number one cause of death in Africa and the total numbers will further increase in the next decades reflecting on the growing urbanization and related lifestyle changes. The new epidemic of hypertension and CVD is not only an important public health problem, but it will also have a big economic impact as a significant proportion of the productive population becomes chronically ill or die, leaving their families in poverty. It is essential to develop and share best practices for affordable and effective  community-based programs in screening and treatment of hypertension. In order to prevent and control hypertension in the population, Africa  needs policies developed and implemented through a multi-sectoral  approach involving the Ministries of Health and other sectors including education, agriculture, transport, finance among others.},

The 1st research question was whether inequity influenced burnout across time. The 2nd research question was whether longitudinal relations between equity and burnout were curvilinear, as predicted by equity theory. The results confirmed that inequity affects the central component of burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion) and that this relation is curvilinear. Feeling more deprived and feeling more advantaged resulted in higher future emotional exhaustion levels. No indication was found for a longitudinal relation between inequity and depersonalization. A synchronous relation was found suggesting that personal accomplishment influences equity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Self-Management Support strategies, including the use of mobile technology, have shown potential benefit. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a mobile phone support intervention on top of an existing strategy in three countries, DR Congo, Cambodia and the Philippines to improve health outcomes, access to care and enablement of people with diabetes, with 480 people with diabetes in each country who are randomized to either standard support or to the intervention. Design/methods: The study consists of three sub-studies with a similar design in three countries to be independently implemented and analyzed. The design is a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial, in which a total of 480 adults with diabetes participating in an existing DSME programme will be randomly allocated to either usual care in the existing programme or to usual care plus a mobile phone self-management support intervention. Participants in both arms complete assessments at baseline, one year and two years after inclusion. Glycosylated haemoglobin blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference will be measured. Individual interviews will be conducted to determine the patients' assessment of chronic illness care, degree of self-enablement, and access to care before implementation of the intervention, at intermediate moments and at the end of the study. Analyses of quantitative data including assessment of differences in changes in outcomes between the intervention and usual care group will be done. A probability of {$<$}0.05 is considered statistically significant. Outcome indicators will be plotted over time. All data are analyzed for confounding and interaction in multivariate regression analyses taking potential clustering effects into account. Differences in outcome measures will be analyzed per country and realistic evaluation to assess processes and context factors that influence implementation in order to understand why it works, for whom, under which circumstances. A costing study will be performed. Discussion: The intervention addresses the problem that the greater part of diabetes management takes place without external support and that many challenges, unforeseen problems and questions occur at moments in between scheduled contacts with the support system, by exploiting communication technology},

Through media and community advertizing, 418 suicidal adults were recruited to an online portal and were delivered the intervention program (Living with Deadly Thoughts) or a control program (Living Well). The primary outcome was severity of suicidal thinking, assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed significant reductions in the severity of suicidal thinking at postintervention, 6, and 12 months. However, no overall group differences were found. Conclusions: Living with Deadly Thoughts was of no greater effectiveness than the control group. Further investigation into the conditions under which this program may be beneficial is now needed. Limitations of this trial include it being underpowered given the effect size ultimately observed, a high attrition rate, and the inability of determining suicide deaths or of verifying self-reported suicide attempts.},

Research design and methods Data from 74\,857 Lifelines Cohort and Biobank Study participants were used to regress occupational group membership, coded by Statistics Netherlands, on the prevalence and incidence of MetS using logistic and Cox regression analyses. MetS diagnosis was based on physical examinations, blood analysis, and recorded medication use. Information on age, smoking status, physical activity, diet and alcohol consumption was acquired using questionnaires. Results Baseline MetS prevalence was 17.5\% for males and 10.6\% for females. During a median 3.8\,years of follow-up, MetS incidence was 7.8\% for males and 13.2\% for females. One occupational group was associated with an increased MetS risk in both sexes. Six additional occupational groups had an increased risk for MetS among men, four among women. Highest risks were found for male `stationary plant and machine operators' (HR: 1.94; 95\%\,CI 1.26 to 3.00) and female `food preparation assistants' (HR: 1.80; 95\%\,CI 1.01 to 3.22). Conclusions Findings suggest that occupational group matters for men and women in MetS development, and that differences in MetS prevalence across occupations are not merely a reflection of selection of metabolically unhealthy workers into specific occupations. The striking sex differences in the occupational distribution of MetS indicate that preventive measures should, with some exceptions, target men and women separately.},

More than 5,400,000 people died from war-related causes since 1998 and exposure to violence was wide-spread. This study investigated the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on perceived health and physical and social functioning, filling an important gap in the current literature. Data were collected from a sample of 93 adults living in Bunia, Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Structured in-person interviews included the PTSD section of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale. Additional questions were included to assess social resources. Study recruitment was balanced to achieve equal representation of both sexes and each quarter of town. Forty percent met symptom criteria for probable PTSD. Individuals with PTSD reported poor perceived general health and had high disability scores compared to those without PTSD. Of the three PTSD symptom clusters, hyperarousal was most strongly associated with disability. Individuals with PTSD were significantly more emotionally affected by their health problems than those without PTSD (85\% versus 41\%), had more difficulties in activities involving social contact (54\% versus 16\%) and in doing their daily work (54\% versus 20\%). The impact of war-related violence on mental health is severe in the DRC. Psychosocial interventions developed in conflict areas might be best targeted primarily to supporting social functioning and reducing hyperarousal. Implications for clinical treatment and future directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {Self-management is critical for the prevention and control of chronic health conditions. Research shows that dietary and physical activity behaviors related to obesity are inextricably linked to the development, course, and outcomes of Type 2 diabetes and its comorbidities. Therefore, a compelling case has been made for behavioral lifestyle intervention as the first-line approach. Academic psychologists and other behavioral scientists have contributed to all stages of obesity and diabetes prevention research and practice. They have made seminal contributions to the evidence-based science of health behavior change with the National Institutes of Health funded Diabetes Prevention Program randomized clinical trial and subsequent translation and dissemination efforts as exemplars. Beginning with social\textendash cognitive learning theory and behavior modification for obesity, research psychologists have elucidated the critical elements associated with treatment efficacy and have demonstrated the benefits of identifying individuals at elevated risk and providing early intervention. Most often, the psychologist's role has been to design and evaluate programs based on behavioral principles, or supervise, train, and facilitate adherence to interventions, rather than function as the primary provider. Lifestyle interventions have made a strong public health impact, but pressing challenges remain. Issues include difficulties with long-term weight loss maintenance, heterogeneity of treatment response, pragmatic translation and dissemination concerns such as optimal training and delivery formats, scalability of lifestyle intervention programs, reimbursement, and a need for environmental and policy approaches that promote healthy lifestyle norms and behaviors for all communities. Health psychology should be at the forefront in addressing all of these concerns.},

We first examine empirically calibrated simulations grounded in survey data to evaluate the relative performance of each estimator under ideal sampling conditions consistent with respondent-driven sampling assumptions and under conditions that mimic observed respondent-driven sampling recruitment processes. One estimator, which incorporates respondents' reports on their network of contacts, substantially out-performs the others under all conditions. We then apply the estimators to empirical samples of female sex workers collected in two Chinese cities which include unique data on respondents' networks. These empirical results are consistent with the simulation results, suggesting that traditional respondent-driven sampling estimators overestimate the proportion of female sex workers working in low tiers of sex work and are likely to overstate the STI risk profiles of these populations.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The Philippines has seen rapid increases in HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs. We study 2 neighboring cities where a linked HIV epidemic differed in timing of onset and levels of prevalence. In Cebu, prevalence rose rapidly from below 1\% to 54\% between 2009 and 2011 and remained high through 2013. In nearby Mandaue, HIV remained below 4\% through 2011 then rose rapidly to 38\% by 2013. Objectives: We hypothesize that infection prevalence differences in these cities may owe to aspects of social network structure, specifically levels of network clustering. Building on previous research, we hypothesize that higher levels of network clustering are associated with greater epidemic potential. Methods: Data were collected with respondent-driven sampling among men who inject drugs in Cebu and Mandaue in 2013. We first examine sample composition using estimators for population means. We then apply new estimators of network clustering in respondentdriven sampling data to examine associations with HIV prevalence. Results: Samples in both cities were comparable in composition by age, education, and injection locations. Dyadic needle-sharing levels were also similar between the 2 cities, but network clustering in the needle-sharing network differed dramatically. We found higher clustering in Cebu than Mandaue, consistent with expectations that higher clustering is associated with faster epidemic spread. Conclusions: This article is the first to apply estimators of network clustering to empirical respondent-driven samples, and it offers suggestive evidence that researchers should pay greater attention to network structure's role in HIV transmission dynamics.},

We validated the Shona version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in a primary health care clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe. Method Adults aged 18 and above attending the clinic were enrolled over a two-week period in June 2016. After obtaining written consent, trained research assistants administered the tool to eligible participants. Study participants were then interviewed independently using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) as the gold standard by one of five doctors with training in mental health. Result A total of 204 participants were assessed. Of these, 91 (44.6\%) were HIV positive, 100 (49\%) were HIV negative, while 13 (6.4\%) did not know their HIV status. PTSD was diagnosed in 40 (19.6\%) participants using the gold standard procedure. Using the PCL-5 cut-off of {$\geq$}33, sensitivity and specificity were 74.5\% (95\%CI: 60.4\textendash 85.7); 70.6\% (95\%CI: 62.7\textendash 77.7), respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 0.78 (95\%CI: 0.72\textendash 0.83). The Shona version of the PCL-5 demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha\,=\,0.92). Conclusion The PCL-5 performed well in this population with a high prevalence of HIV. There is need to explore ways of integrating screening tools for PTSD in interventions delivered by lay health workers in low and middle-income countries (LMIC).},

Multi-component, tailor-made psychosocial interventions are considered to be particularly promising (Brodaty 2003; Spijker 2008). These interventions involve multiple mechanisms of action. In this review we focused solely on the effectiveness of one element within psychosocial interventions, cognitive reframing. Cognitive reframing is a component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In dementia care, cognitive reframing interventions focus on family carers' maladaptive, self-defeating or distressing cognitions about their relatives' behaviors and about their own performance in the caring role.},

In Study 1 (N =327), we investigated gender differences in organizational culture preferences, both in a managerial sample and a sample of non-managerial professionals in private sector organizations. It was shown that gender differences only existed in the non-managerial groups, with women showing less masculine culture preferences than men did. In Study 2 (N =350), we examined the effects of organizational culture preferences on the ambitions of staff employees and middle-level managers to pursue a career at a top management level in one governmental organization. The results showed that organizational culture preferences were predictive for ambition of non-managerial employees, but not for that of middle management employees. Overall, women were less ambitious than men, and even ambitious women perceived work-home conflict as an important barrier to career advancement.},

Relationships have been shown with both physical and psychological problems. The aim of this study is to analyse the direct and indirect effect that emotional intelligence exerts over the manifestation of physical and psychological clinical symptomatology and to severe disorders such as burnout syndrome in a professional group in which social function is fundamental. Method: So that, 881 Latin-American catholic priests (M age=45.89; SD age=11.58) were evaluated using the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-22 and the General Health Questionnaire-28. Results: Using path analysis, emotional intelligence, especially Attention and Emotional Clarity, shows a high effect on psychological and somatic issues. Conclusions: Thus, both specific disorders and general well-being are related to emotional intelligence. Providing effective emotional intelligence training sessions seems to be able to reduce possible physical and emotional disorders.

Among the key challenges facing the DRC today is the question of how the country will address the massive human rights atrocities of its recent past to establish a foundation for peace and security, the rule of law, and respect for human rights to prevail in the future. The 2006 elections capped an era of international armed conflict and massive violence in the DRC that began with Laurent Desire Kabila's 1996-97 campaign to liberate Congo from decades of repressive rule under Mobutu Sese Seko. The advent of an elected government sets the stage for state-building initiatives focusing on governance and critical long-term institutional reform in the security and justice sectors. Yet armed conflict and mass violence continue to plague eastern DRC. This report presents the results of a population survey undertaken by the Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley, the Payson Center at Tulane University, and the International Center for Transitional Justice. Focusing on areas most affected by conflict in eastern DRC, surveys were conducted from September to December 2007 among a sample population of 2,620 individuals in the Ituri district in Oriental province and the provinces of North and South Kivu. The report concentrates its analysis on the survey results in eastern DRC, but comparative interviews were also conducted among a sample population of 1,133 individuals in Kinshasa and Kisangani. The survey sought to assess exposure to violence among the population, understand the priorities and needs of Congolese civilians affected by the conflicts, and capture attitudes about peace, social reconstruction, and transitional justice mechanisms.},

Both groups had sessions on a weekly basis for 8 weeks and completed questionnaires at baseline, week 8, and 1 month after the intervention. Participants completed questionnaires, which included self-report of depressive and anxiety symptoms, health status (e.g., quality of life and functioning), social bonding, and perception of the credibility of the two interventions., Results: Both groups showed improvements in depression, anxiety, emotional well being, and social functioning as measured by respective scales. Social bonding also increased in both groups during the study and may be a mechanism for both interventions. Participants found both interventions credible., Conclusions: In this pilot study, Ngoma showed significant and durable beneficial effects comparable to MBSR. The effects of Ngoma and other indigenous rhythm-dance ceremonies on distress and health status in western culture should be investigated in larger clinical studies.},

Approximately 65~\% of those surveyed were either suffering from burnout or on the verge of burnout. Statistical differences in coping mechanism use were found between those who were and were not experiencing some level of burnout. The results of this study add to the existing understanding of occupational burnout among clergy members and ways in which burnout may be alleviated.},

  abstract = {The social desirability bias can be considered a two-dimensional construct, consisting of impression management and self-deception. Although social desirability is often considered a threat to the validity of intimate partner violence (IPV) reports, little is known about which dimension is most responsible for this distortion. Furthermore, it is unclear whether social desirability distorts the report of relationship satisfaction. In this study, two instruments that claim to measure social desirability are investigated on their ability to measure impression management and self-deception. Afterward, which dimension (if any) is responsible for a distortion in IPV and relationship satisfaction reports is examined. The survey consisted of the following measures: the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales for IPV, the Couples Satisfaction Index for relationship satisfaction and the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding, the Limited Disclosure Scale, and the Idealistic Distortion Scale for social desirability. The Limited Disclosure Scale was found to predominantly measure impression management. The Idealistic Distortion Scale did not measure social desirability well and appeared to be a bad measure for relationship satisfaction. Both the reports of IPV and relationship satisfaction were influenced by impression management, but not by self-deception. However, impression management and self-deception only accounted for a small portion of the variance in IPV and relationship satisfaction reports. These results indicate that the social desirability bias, when reporting IPV and relationship satisfaction, is a conscious process, but that its influence on IPV and relationship satisfaction reports might be overrated.},

Psychiatric inpatients (N=148) and healthy control subjects (N=148) participated in this cross-sectional questionnaire study. In both samples, the degree of fit was adequate. The final CFA with covariates model showed significant and positive associations between CS and clinical status and education respectively, between CS, BS, BoS and frequency of verbal abuse, between CS and BoS and GSI and between CS and BS and harm avoidance and in addition we found negative associations between each of the shame factors and age.

Schnabel and Bock mistakenly concluded otherwise because their analytical strategy was not sufficiently sensitive to detect very slow change (leading them to miss signs of declining intense religion on the indicators they examined), they examined a limited set of indicators (missing still more signs of declining intense religion), and they paid insufficient attention to cohort differences. Overall, their empirical conclusion that ``only moderate religion is on the decline in the United States'' is simply false. And their interpretive conclusion that ``intense religion in the United States is persistent and exceptional in ways that do not fit the secularization thesis'' should be rejected.},

Recent behavioural and neuroimaging data show that psychedelics modulate neural circuits that have been implicated in mood and affective disorders, and can reduce the clinical symptoms of these disorders.

This paper models religious participation as an imperfect public good which, absent intervention, yields suboptimal participation by members from the church's perspective. Megachurches address this problem in part by employing secular-based group activities to subsidize religious participation that then translates into an increase in the attendees' religious investment. This strategy not only allows megachurches to attract and retain new members when many traditional churches are losing members but also results in higher levels of an individual's religious capital. As a result, the megachurch may raise expectations of members' levels of commitment and faith practices. Data from the FACT2000 survey provide evidence that megachurches employ groups more extensively than other churches, and this approach is consistent with a strategy to use groups to help subsidize individuals' religious investment. Religious capital rises among members of megachurches relative to members of non-megachurches as a result of this strategy.},

We investigated whether the IL-6 response would habituate in response to a repetitively applied mental stressor and whether cortisol reactivity would show a relationship with IL-6 reactivity. Study participants were 21 reasonably healthy men (mean age 46+/-7 years) who underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (combination of a 3-min preparation, 5-min speech, and 5-min mental arithmetic) three times with an interval of 1 week. Plasma IL-6 and free salivary cortisol were measured immediately before and after stress, and at 45 and 105 min of recovery from stress. Cortisol samples were also obtained 15 and 30 min after stress. Compared to non-stressed controls, IL-6 significantly increased between rest and 45 min post-stress (p=.022) and between rest and 105 min post-stress (p=.001). Peak cortisol (p=.034) and systolic blood pressure (p=.009) responses to stress both habituated between weeks one and three. No adaptation occurred in diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and IL-6 responses to stress. The areas under the curve integrating the stress-induced changes in cortisol and IL-6 reactivity were negatively correlated at visit three (r=-.54, p=.011), but not at visit one. The IL-6 response to acute mental stress occurs delayed and shows no adaptation to repeated moderate mental stress. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis may attenuate stress reactivity of IL-6. The lack of habituation in IL-6 responses to daily stress could subject at-risk individuals to higher atherosclerotic morbidity and mortality.},

Exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity to work-related stressors or incomplete recovery after work is a proposed mechanism underlying this increase in risk. This study examined the effects of work stress on 24-hour profiles of the pre-ejection period (PEP), a measure of cardiac sympathetic activity, obtained from ambulatory measurement of the impedance cardiogram.         Methods:~A total of 67 male white-collar workers (age 47.1 {$\pm$} 5.2) underwent ambulatory monitoring on 2 workdays and 1 non-workday. Work stress was defined according to Siegrist's model as 1) a combination of high effort and low reward at work (high imbalance) or 2) an exhaustive work-related coping style (high overcommitment).         Results:~High overcommitment was associated with shorter absolute PEP levels during all periods on all 3 measurement days, reduced wake-to-sleep PEP differences and reduced PEP variability, as indexed by the SD.         Conclusions:~Overcommitment to work was associated with an increase in basal sympathetic drive and a reduction in the dynamic range of cardiac sympathetic regulation.

The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize the range of adverse childhood experiences faced by young adults who grew up in a low-income urban area. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with young adults who grew up in low-income Philadelphia neighborhoods. Using the nominal group technique, participants generated a list of adverse childhood experiences and then identified the 5 most stressful experiences on the group list. The most stressful experiences identified by participants were grouped into a ranked list of domains and subdomains. RESULTS: Participants identified a range of experiences, grouped into 10 domains: family relationships, community stressors, personal victimization, economic hardship, peer relationships, discrimination, school, health, child welfare/juvenile justice, and media/technology. Included in these domains were many but not all of the experiences from the initial ACEs studies; parental divorce/separation and mental illness were absent. Additional experiences not included in the initial ACEs but endorsed by our participants included single-parent homes; exposure to violence, adult themes, and criminal behavior; personal victimization; bullying; economic hardship; and discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Gathering youth perspectives on childhood adversity broadens our understanding of the experience of stress and trauma in childhood. Future work is needed to determine the significance of this broader set of adverse experiences in predisposing children to poor health outcomes as adults. Pediatrics 2014;134:e13\textendash e20},

To address this, the authors present a cross-national examination of the emergence of the gender gap in depression during adolescence using national longitudinal panel data from Canada, Great Britain, and the United States. Method: The two-wave, 1994\textendash 1996 Canadian National Population Health Survey uses a diagnostic measure across a 24-month interval, providing 12-month prevalence rates of major depressive disorder. The British Youth Panel measures depressive symptomatology across five annual waves beginning in 1995. The two-wave, 1995\textendash 1996 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health uses a measure of depressive symptomatology across a 12-month interval. Results: Females have significantly higher rates of depression for each sample overall. When samples are decomposed by age, the gender gap in depression consistently emerges by age 14 across all three national samples, irrespective of the measure used or whether categorical cutoffs or untransformed scale scores are used to assess depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: There is a consistent pattern in the onset of the gender gap in depression at age 14 across all three countries and measures. This consistency provides important etiologic clues concerning underlying causes of depression and identifies at what age diagnosis, treatment, and intervention strategies should be directed. J. Am.

Study Design and Setting: A common metric for 11 depression questionnaires was developed applying item response theory (IRT) methods. Data of 33,844 adults were used for secondary analysis including routine assessments of 23,817 in- and outpatients with mental and/or medical conditions (46\% with depressive disorders) and a general population sample of 10,027 randomly selected participants from three representative German household surveys. Results: A standardized metric for depression severity was defined by 143 items, and scores were normed to a general population mean of 50 (standard deviation 5 10) for easy interpretability. It covers the entire range of depression severity assessed by established instruments. The metric allows comparisons among included measures. Large differences were found in their measurement precision and range, providing a rationale for instrument selection. Published scale-specific threshold scores of depression severity showed remarkable consistencies across different questionnaires. Conclusion: An IRT-based instrument-independent metric for depression severity enables direct comparisons among established measures. The ``common ruler'' simplifies the interpretation of depression assessment by identifying key thresholds for clinical and epidemiologic decision making and facilitates integrative psychometric research across studies, including meta-analysis. \'O 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using Canadian census and survey data, this study finds no evidence that wage gaps have attenuated for gay men and only small reductions for lesbians and heterosexual women, relative to heterosexual men. Wage gaps are larger for younger gay men than for older gay men, which may suggest a ``coming out penalty''. The lesbian wage premium, vis-\'a-vis heterosexual women, does not appear at initial labor market entry; rather it develops with duration in the labour market.},

We found evidence for each of the four life course models for white women, whereas the sensitive period was indicated for white men. Upward mobility was also associated with higher CVD risk among white men as compared to those who were socio-economically advantaged at both time points. The pathway model was significant for Latino women. No life course models were significant for black men or women or Latino men. Our findings demonstrate the importance of applying an intersectional lens to understanding CVD risk over the life course.},

Setting and Participants:~         Data (N = 4917) from the 2017 North Carolina Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS).         Design:~         Cross-sectional.         Main Measures:~         Examine whether a lifetime history of TBI with loss of consciousness (LOC) or having a history of TBI with LOC prior to 18 years of age was associated with a greater likelihood of lifetime depression, current binge drinking, and current cigarette and e-cigarette smoking.         Results:~         Respondents with a history of TBI with LOC had 2.1 (95\% CI, 1.6-2.8) times higher odds of lifetime depression and 1.7 to 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.02-2.97) times higher odds of all risk behaviors than those without a lifetime history of TBI with LOC. There were no statistical differences between age of first TBI with LOC and lifetime depression, binge drinking, cigarette smoking, and e-cigarette use after controlling for key demographics.         Conclusion:~         These findings underscore the importance of increasing awareness among healthcare providers of the prevalence of lifetime depression and risk behaviors among individuals with a history of TBI and the need for improved screening and referrals to evidence-based services.},

The problem is essentially a tradeoff between the bias and the variance of the regression coefficient estimator. An array of diagnostic tests for informative weights have been developed. Nonetheless, studies comparing the performance of the tests, especially for finite samples, are scarce, and the theoretical equivalence of some tests has not been investigated. Focusing on the linear regression setting, we review a collection of such tests and propose enhanced versions of some of them that require an auxiliary regression model for the weight. Further, the equivalence of two popular tests is established which has not been reported before. In contrast to existing reviews with no empirical comparison, we compare the sizes and powers of the tests in simulation studies. The reviewed tests are applied to a regression analysis of the family expenditure using the data from the China Family Panel Study.},

This study examines the relationship between higher education and religion in a non-Western context, China, where children are typically raised in secular contexts and anti-religious ideology permeates the education system. For Chinese youth, college is often individuals' first significant exposure to religious perspectives. Using data from the 2007 Spiritual Life Study of Chinese Residents, we find that the influence of education on religion is not a secularizing one: Although the least educated are more likely to identify themselves as members of a religious group, this is true only of older adults. People with at least some college education report similar levels of religious salience and belief in their lives compared to both the least and moderately educated. In fact, younger adults who went to college are more likely to hold a religious belief than younger adults with only a primary school education, and more likely to report religion is important to them than those with a middle or high school education. Moreover, college-educated people are more likely to tolerate religious beliefs as alternatives to communism, and younger adults who went to college are more tolerant of religion vis-a`-vis science than are younger adults with middle or high school education.},

These transformations can give the data analyst insight into the relationships between these variables so that relationship between them can be best described and non-linear relationships can be uncovered. The power and usefulness of ACE guided transformation in multivariate analysis are illustrated using a simulated data set as well as a real data set. The results from these examples clearly demonstrate that ACE is able to identify the correct functional forms, to reveal more accurate relationships, and to improve the model fit considerably compared to the conventional linear model.},

We also describe and demonstrate empirical strategies for estimating the magnitude of such biases in longitudinal surveys, and we provide illustrative empirical results that are germane to social science research.

These revisions, called ``data reduction,'' help produce shorter, more concise data tables. The RADaR technique converts raw, textual data into a more manageable and user-friendly format. It is rigorous because of the systematic analysis that occurs during each step of the process, and it is accelerated because the time required to review and reduce each phase of the data table becomes shorter as the user produces more condensed and concise presentations of the textual data.},

  abstract = {Objective This study examined whether a polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) moderates cardiovascular reactivity to social threat. Methods Psychologically healthy young adults delivered a speech and performed mental arithmetic in one of three conditions: a) an evaluative audience condition that gave disapproving and negative nonverbal social signals (n=59); b) an evaluative audience condition that provided supportive social signals (n=60); or c) a no audience condition (n=65). Heart rate (HR) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were measured before, during, and after the stress tasks to assess cardiovascular reactivity and recovery. Results In the negative audience condition, there was a significant association between the 5-HTTLPR and SBP, DBP, and HR reactivity. Individuals with the short/short genotype showed the greatest reactivity. The DBP and HR reactivity of short/short individuals in the negative audience condition was also greater than that of individuals with the short/short genotype in the no audience condition. These associations of the 5-HTLPR with HR reactivity were moderated by gender, being limited to females. With respect to cardiovascular recovery, short/short individuals in the negative audience condition exhibited impaired DBP recovery relative to other genotypes in the same condition as well as short/short individuals in the no audience condition. Conclusions The 5-HTTLPR moderates cardiovascular reactivity to stress in a threatening evaluative social context, which suggests that the serotonin system may be involved in the processes by which stressful, conflict-ridden social environments affect risk for cardiovascular-related health outcomes.},

  abstract = {The present study examined messages about mental illness in 14 contemporary Christian self-help bestsellers. Content analysis revealed that most texts focused upon depression. Categories of textual units included Underlying Assumptions Regarding Depression, Representations of Depression, Roots/Causes/Reasons for Depression, and Christian Responses to Depression. Demonic influence was the most frequently cited reason for depression. Other reasons included negative cognitions, failure as a Christian, and negative emotions. Christian responses to depression included trusting God, religious activity, and individual willpower. Discussion of these results focused upon the problematic impact of these messages upon individuals with depression, and upon suggestions for reducing mental illness stigma in religious communities.},

Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that 2 factors, labeled Anxiety and Avoidance, provided a good fit to the data after removing the influence of response sets.

  abstract = {Background\textemdash The metabolic syndrome predicts future coronary artery disease and type II diabetes and often emerges in childhood. Tobacco smoke potentially contributes to insulin resistance in this syndrome. This study evaluates the association of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and active smoking with the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in US adolescents. Methods and Results\textemdash Data from 2273 subjects 12 to 19 years of age were examined from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III, 1988 to 1994). Serum cotinine levels, presence of household smokers, and self-report of smoking were used to determine ETS exposure and active smoking. The metabolic syndrome was defined as having Ն3 criteria from the National Cholesterol Education Panel definition. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted. Among adolescents, 5.6\% met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, and prevalence increased with tobacco exposure: 1.2\% for nonexposed, 5.4\% for those exposed to ETS, and 8.7\% for active smokers (PϽ0.001). In adolescents at risk for overweight and overweight adolescents (body mass index above the 85th percentile), a similar relationship was observed: 5.6\% for nonexposed, 19.6\% for those exposed to ETS, and 23.6\% for active smokers (Pϭ0.01). In multivariable logistic regression analyses among all adolescents, ETS exposure was independently associated with the metabolic syndrome (ETS exposure: odds ratio, 4.7, 95\% CI, 1.7 to 12.9; active smoking: odds ratio, 6.1; 95\% CI, 2.8 to 13.4). Conclusions\textemdash Considering that tobacco and obesity are the 2 leading causes of preventable death in the United States, these findings of a dose-response, cotinine-confirmed relationship between tobacco smoke and metabolic syndrome among adolescents may have profound implications for the future health of the public.

However, RDS data are unique and require specialized analysis techniques, many of which remain underdeveloped. RDS sample size estimation requires knowing design effect (DE), which can only be calculated post hoc. Few studies have analyzed RDS DE using real world empirical data. We analyze estimated DE from 43 samples of IDU collected using a standardized protocol. We find the previous recommendation that sample size be at least doubled, consistent with DE = 2, underestimates true DE and recommend researchers use DE = 4 as an alternate estimate when calculating sample size. A formula for calculating sample size for RDS studies among IDU is presented. Researchers faced with limited resources may wish to accept slightly higher standard errors to keep sample size requirements low. Our results highlight dangers of ignoring sampling design in analysis.},

  abstract = {Introduction  The number of people with diabetes in Africa is projected to increase substantially in the next two decades, due to factors including rapid urbanisation, adoption of unhealthy diets and exercise patterns and the ageing of the population. There are currently uncertainties regarding the incidence, prevalence and management patterns of diabetes in older people across the diversity of African countries. We wish to perform a systematic review to determine the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Africa in the older individual, over the age of 55\hspace{0.25em}years, reported in studies from 2000 to 2013. Methods and analyses A comprehensive literature search among a number of databases will be undertaken, using an African search filter to identify diabetes prevalence studies that were published from 2000 to 2013. Full copies of articles identified by the search, and considered to meet the inclusion criteria, will be obtained for data extraction and synthesis. Statistical analysis of the primary measures, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and oral glucose tolerance test will include two steps: (1) identification of data sources and documenting estimates and (2) application of the random-effects meta-analysis model to aggregate prevalence estimates and account for between study variability in calculating the overall pooled estimates and 95\% CI for diabetes prevalence. Heterogeneity will be evaluated using the I2 statistic to determine the extent of variation in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. This systematic review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Ethics and dissemination  Ethics is not required for this study, given that this is a protocol for a systematic review, which utilises published data. The findings of this study will be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.},

Global policy makers are advocating that institution-living orphans and abandoned children (OAC) be moved as quickly as possible to a residential family setting and that institutional care be used as a last resort. This analysis tests the hypothesis that institutional care for OAC aged 6\textendash 12 is associated with worse health and wellbeing than community residential care using conservative two-tail tests. Methodology: The Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) study employed two-stage random sampling survey methodology in 6 sites across 5 countries to identify 1,357 institution-living and 1,480 community-living OAC ages 6\textendash 12, 658 of whom were double-orphans or abandoned by both biological parents. Survey analytic techniques were used to compare cognitive functioning, emotion, behavior, physical health, and growth. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the proportion of variability in child outcomes attributable to the study site, care setting, and child levels and institutional versus community care settings. Conservative analyses limited the community living children to doubleorphans or abandoned children. Principal Findings: Health, emotional and cognitive functioning, and physical growth were no worse for institution-living than community-living OAC, and generally better than for community-living OAC cared for by persons other than a biological parent. Differences between study sites explained 2\textendash 23\% of the total variability in child outcomes, while differences between care settings within sites explained 8\textendash 21\%. Differences among children within care settings explained 64\textendash 87\%. After adjusting for sites, age, and gender, institution vs. community-living explained only 0.3\textendash 7\% of the variability in child outcomes. Conclusion: This study does not support the hypothesis that institutional care is systematically associated with poorer wellbeing than community care for OAC aged 6\textendash 12 in those countries facing the greatest OAC burden. Much greater variability among children within care settings was observed than among care settings type. Methodologically rigorous studies must be conducted in those countries facing the new OAC epidemic in order to understand which characteristics of care promote child wellbeing. Such characteristics may transcend the structural definitions of institutions or family homes.},

  abstract = {Summary Background We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to estimate the burden of disease attributable to mental and substance use disorders in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs). Methods For each of the 20 mental and substance use disorders included in GBD 2010, we systematically reviewed epidemiological data and used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR, to model prevalence by age, sex, country, region, and year. We obtained disability weights from representative community surveys and an internet-based survey to calculate YLDs. We calculated premature mortality as YLLs from cause of death estimates for 1980\textendash 2010 for 20 age groups, both sexes, and 187 countries. We derived DALYs from the sum of YLDs and YLLs. We adjusted burden estimates for comorbidity and present them with 95\% uncertainty intervals. Findings In 2010, mental and substance use disorders accounted for 183{$\cdot$}9 million DALYs (95\% UI 153{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 216{$\cdot$}7 million), or 7{$\cdot$}4\% (6{$\cdot$}2\textendash 8{$\cdot$}6) of all DALYs worldwide. Such disorders accounted for 8{$\cdot$}6 million YLLs (6{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 12{$\cdot$}1 million; 0{$\cdot$}5\% [0{$\cdot$}4\textendash 0{$\cdot$}7] of all YLLs) and 175{$\cdot$}3 million YLDs (144{$\cdot$}5 million\textendash 207{$\cdot$}8 million; 22{$\cdot$}9\% [18{$\cdot$}6\textendash 27{$\cdot$}2] of all YLDs). Mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of YLDs worldwide. Depressive disorders accounted for 40{$\cdot$}5\% (31{$\cdot$}7\textendash 49{$\cdot$}2) of DALYs caused by mental and substance use disorders, with anxiety disorders accounting for 14{$\cdot$}6\% (11{$\cdot$}2\textendash 18{$\cdot$}4), illicit drug use disorders for 10{$\cdot$}9\% (8{$\cdot$}9\textendash 13{$\cdot$}2), alcohol use disorders for 9{$\cdot$}6\% (7{$\cdot$}7\textendash 11{$\cdot$}8), schizophrenia for 7{$\cdot$}4\% (5{$\cdot$}0\textendash 9{$\cdot$}8), bipolar disorder for 7{$\cdot$}0\% (4{$\cdot$}4\textendash 10{$\cdot$}3), pervasive developmental disorders for 4{$\cdot$}2\% (3{$\cdot$}2\textendash 5{$\cdot$}3), childhood behavioural disorders for 3{$\cdot$}4\% (2{$\cdot$}2\textendash 4{$\cdot$}7), and eating disorders for 1{$\cdot$}2\% (0{$\cdot$}9\textendash 1{$\cdot$}5). DALYs varied by age and sex, with the highest proportion of total DALYs occurring in people aged 10\textendash 29 years. The burden of mental and substance use disorders increased by 37{$\cdot$}6\% between 1990 and 2010, which for most disorders was driven by population growth and ageing. Interpretation Despite the apparently small contribution of YLLs\textemdash with deaths in people with mental disorders coded to the physical cause of death and suicide coded to the category of injuries under self-harm\textemdash our findings show the striking and growing challenge that these disorders pose for health systems in developed and developing regions. In view of the magnitude of their contribution, improvement in population health is only possible if countries make the prevention and treatment of mental and substance use disorders a public health priority.

  abstract = {Why do so many conservative Christians continue to support Donald Trump despite his many overt moral failings? Why do many Americans advocate so vehemently for xenophobic policies, such as a border wall with Mexico? Why do many Americans seem so unwilling to acknowledge the injustices that ethnic and racial minorities experience in the United States? Why do a sizeable proportion of Americans continue to oppose women's equality in the workplace and in the home? To answer these questions, Taking America Back for God points to the phenomenon of "Christian nationalism," the belief that the United States is-and should be-a Christian nation. Christian ideals and symbols have long played an important role in American public life, but Christian nationalism is about far more than whether the phrase "under God" belongs in the pledge of allegiance. At its heart, Christian nationalism demands that we must preserve a particular kind of social order, an order in which everyone--Christians and non-Christians, native-born and immigrants, whites and minorities, men and women recognizes their "proper" place in society. The first comprehensive empirical analysis of Christian nationalism in the United States, Taking America Back for God illustrates the influence of Christian nationalism on today's most contentious social and political issues. Drawing on multiple sources of national survey data as well as in-depth interviews, Andrew Whitehead and Samuel Perry document how Christian nationalism shapes what Americans think about who they are as a people, what their future should look like, and how they should get there. Americans' stance toward Christian nationalism provides powerful insight into what they think about immigration, Islam, gun control, police shootings, atheists, gender roles, and many other political issues-very much including who they want in the White House. Taking America Back for God is a guide to one of the most important-and least understood-forces shaping American politics.},

Instead, religious beliefs and social supports associated with church attendance may help urban mothers make the transition to marriage in communities where marriage has become increasingly infrequent.},

On the other hand, ambulatory assessment is less constrained and provides naturalistic data on emotion in daily life, with the potential to (1) assure external validity of laboratory findings, (2) provide normative data on prevalence, quality and intensity of real-life emotion and associated processes, (3) characterize previously unidentified emotional phenomena, and (4) model real-life stimuli for representative laboratory research design. Technological innovations now allow for detailed ambulatory study of emotion across domains of subjective experience, overt behavior and physiology. However, methodological challenges abound that may compromise attempts to characterize biobehavioral aspects of emotion in the real world. For example, emotional effects can be masked by social engagement, mental and physical workloads, as well as by food intake and circadian and quasirandom variation in metabolic activity. The complexity of data streams and multitude of factors that influence them require a high degree of context specification for meaningful data interpretation. We consider possible solutions to typical and often overlooked issues related to ambulatory emotion research, including aspects of study design decisions, recording devices and channels, electronic diary implementation, and data analysis.},

New charitable giving data are collected in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and used to estimate the regression models. The regression models are estimated using a wide variety of techniques and specification tests, and the strength of the intergenerational giving correlations is compared with intergenerational correlations in income, wealth, and consumption expenditure from the same sample using the same set of controls. We find the religious giving of parents and children to be strongly correlated, as strongly correlated as are their income and wealth. The correlation in the secular giving (e.g., giving to the United Way, educational institutions, for poverty relief) of parents and children is smaller, similar in magnitude to the intergenerational correlation in consumption. Parents' religious giving is positively associated with children's secular giving, but in a more limited sense. Overall, the results are consistent with generosity emerging at least in part from the influence of parental charitable behavior. In contrast to intergenerational models in which parental generosity towards their children can undo government transfer policy (Ricardian equivalence), these results suggest that parental generosity towards charitable organizations might reinforce government policies, such as tax incentives aimed at encouraging voluntary transfers.},

  abstract = {Evidence is widespread of declining religiosity measures in many countries, including some outside of Europe. Is this a transition toward secularity among general populations, or instead a change in the nature of individual spiritualities? This question is addressed by this study with International Social Survey Programme data spanning 27 years (1991\textendash 2018) and 46 nations. Many measures of religiosity and belief are found to be declining in most countries, supporting secular transition theory. Identifying as spiritual but not religious remains a minority phenomenon in areas with low levels of religiosity, but an important phenomenon nonetheless that has seen some growth. We argue here that there is a way forward in these data to understand secular transition and individual spiritualization theories as complementary, not conflicting.},

Second, they have emphasized the primacy of social structure and context as determinants of racial differences in disease. Third, they have contributed to our understanding of the multiple ways in which racism affects health. Finally, sociologists have enhanced our understanding of the ways in which migration history and status can affect health. Sociological insights on racial disparities in health have important implications for the development of effective approaches to improve health and reduce health inequities.},

We analyze data from the 1996 and 1998 General Social Survey to test alternative predictions from the compositional, inclusive-discrimination, and dispositional perspectives concerning the sources of the racial gap in perceived insecurity. Results from ordered probit regressions provide most support for the inclusive-discrimination perspective, which maintains that employment practices associated with "modern racial prejudice" induce perceived insecurity on a widespread and generalized basis among African Americans. Accordingly, compared to whites, African Americans experience perceived insecurity net of human capital credentials and job/labor market characteristics. Additional analyses provide one qualification to these findings: dynamics associated with the inclusive-discrimination perspective are more pronounced in the private sector than the public sector.

Because mindfulness meditation encourages judgment-free thoughts and feelings, we predicted that participants in the mindfulness condition would be especially likely to form false memories. In two experiments, participants were randomly assigned to either a mindfulness induction, in which they were instructed to focus attention on their breathing, or a mind-wandering induction, in which they were instructed to think about whatever came to mind. The overall number of words from the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm that were correctly recalled did not differ between conditions. However, participants in the mindfulness condition were significantly more likely to report critical nonstudied items than participants in the control condition. In a third experiment, which tested recognition and used a reality-monitoring paradigm, participants had reduced reality-monitoring accuracy after completing the mindfulness induction. These results demonstrate a potential unintended consequence of mindfulness meditation in which memories become less reliable.},

Wilson's achievement is to portray this crisis as one that affects all Americans, and to propose solutions whose benefits would be felt across our society. At a time when welfare is ending and our country's racial dialectic is more strained than ever, When Work Disappears is a sane, courageous, and desperately important work.

Yet black workers often do this labor without recognition, compensation, or support. Operating at the intersection of work, race, gender, and class, Wingfield makes plain the challenges that black employees must overcome and reveals the complicated issues of inequality in today's workplaces and communities.},

In this theoretical article, we attempt to place these various processes under an umbrella term we define as ``racial tasks.'' We examine the ideological, interactional, and physical labor racial minorities perform in mostly White work settings, and the ways these racial tasks vary at different levels of the organizational structure. We consider the ways that the tactics and requirements associated with racial tasks maintain the racial hierarchy of predominantly White organizations and conclude by examining the implications of this work for racial minorities.},

In this review, I consider how increasing racial diversity in the US population informs how emotion work is performed in the current economy. I also discuss how other macrostructural changes such as the rise of aesthetic labor, the gig economy, and the overwhelming growth of the service industry can reshape our understanding of the intersections between race and gender in emotional labor.},

  abstract = {Highly stressed employees are subject to greater health risks, increased cost, and productivity losses than those with normal stress levels. To address this issue in an evidence-based manner, worksite stress management programs must be able to engage individuals as well as capture data on stress, health indices, work productivity, and health care costs. In this randomized controlled pilot, our primary objective was to evaluate the viability and proof of concept for two mind-body workplace stress reduction programs (one therapeutic yoga-based and the other mindfulnessbased), in order to set the stage for larger cost-effectiveness trials. A second objective was to evaluate 2 delivery venues of the mindfulness-based intervention (online vs. in-person). Intention-to-treat principles and 2 (pre and post) ϫ 3 (group) repeated-measures analysis of covariance procedures examined group differences over time on perceived stress and secondary measures to clarify which variables to include in future studies: sleep quality, mood, pain levels, work productivity, mindfulness, blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate variability (a measure of autonomic balance). Two hundred and thirty-nine employee volunteers were randomized into a therapeutic yoga worksite stress reduction program, 1 of 2 mindfulness-based programs, or a control group that participated only in assessment. Compared with the control group, the mind-body interventions showed significantly greater improvements on perceived stress, sleep quality, and the heart rhythm coherence ratio of heart rate variability. The two delivery venues for the mindfulness program produced basically equivalent results. Both the mindfulness-based and therapeutic yoga programs may provide viable and effective interventions to target high stress levels, sleep quality, and autonomic balance in employees.},

The average value of inheritances received among all households did increase but at a slow pace, by 10 percent, but wealth transfers as a proportion of current net worth fell sharply over this period, from 29 to 19 percent.

Using unique data from all associations in a Norwegian county, the article explores hypotheses concerning how size and age affect change behaviour. The results show that high organizational age increases the probability of core change, but decreases the occurrence of peripheral change. The average age of the field in which the organization is active is negatively related to both types of change. The findings suggest that old voluntary organizations are more tenacious than for-profit actors; they choose to attempt change rather than disband if becoming obsolete or pressured by the environment. The degrees of freedom are greater in new, non-institutionalized fields than within fields with a long history. Size has a weakly positive effect on both change indicators. Stronger data and theory-building efforts are needed if we are to extend our knowledge of this under-researched, but immensely important, organization type.},

Advances in low-cost 3D optical technology now allows for development of large image databases that include participants varying in race/ethnicity, body mass, height, age, and circumferences. When combined with contemporary statistical methods, these data sets can be used to create humanoid avatar images with pre-specified anthropometric features.The current study aimed to develop a humanoid avatar series with characteristics of representative US adults extending over the past six decades.3D optical scans were conducted on a demographically diverse sample of 570 healthy adults. Image data was converted to principal components and manifold regression equations were then developed with body mass, height, age, and waist circumference as covariates. Humanoid avatars were generated for representative adults with these four characteristics as reported in Center for Disease Control surveys beginning in 1960-62 up to 2015-18.There was a curvilinear increase in adult US population body mass, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI) in males and females across the nine surveys spanning six decades. A small increase in average adult population age was present between 1960 and 2018; height changes were inconsistent. A series of four avatars developed at approximately 20-year intervals for representative males and females reveal the changes in body size and shape consistent with the emergence of the obesity epidemic. An additional series of developed avatars portray the shapes and sizes of males and females at key BMI cut points.New mathematical approaches and accessible 3D optical technology combined with increasingly available large and diverse data sets across the lifespan now makes unique visualization of body size and shape possible on a previously unattainable scale.The study is registered at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03637855},

Inappropriate handling of the missing data in the analysis can result in misleading conclusions. Here we review a wide range of methods to handle missing outcomes in single and repeated measures data and discuss which methods are most appropriate. Methods Using data from a randomized controlled trial to compare two interventions for increasing physical activity, we compare complete-case analysis; ad hoc imputation techniques such as last observation carried forward and worst-case; model-based imputation; longitudinal models with random effects; and recently proposed joint models for repeated measures data and non-ignorable dropout. Results Estimated intervention effects from ad hoc imputation methods vary widely. Standard multiple imputation and longitudinal modelling agree closely, as they should. Modifying the modelling method to allow for non-ignorable dropout had little effect on estimated intervention effects, but imputing using a common imputation model in both groups gave more conservative results. Conclusions Results from ad hoc imputation methods should be avoided in favour of methods with more plausible assumptions although they may be computationally more complex. Although standard multiple imputation methods and longitudinal modelling methods are equivalent for estimating the treatment effect, the two approaches suggest different ways of relaxing the assumptions, and the choice between them depends on contextual knowledge.},

In this paper, I apply quantitative methods for text analysis to an original collection of more than 21,000 sermons from over 2,100 Christian clergy in the U.S. in order to systematically test theories of clergy political speech in ways that were previously not possible. Extending insights from ethnographic studies, I evaluate the extent to which clergy messages include overtly political commentary, such as explicit critiques (or praises) of political institutions, policies, officials, and organizations, and direct calls to political action. I then assess the conditions under which clergy are more or less likely to engage in explicit political messaging. This analysis demonstrates that while most sermons do not contain explicitly political cues, a substantial proportion of clergy do engage in overtly political cue-giving. Furthermore, the explicitness of messages varies as expected according to variables capturing differences in theological ideology and political engagement. Findings from this analysis have important implications for understandings of clergy influence, explanations for clergy political speech and involvement, and political inequality.},

This article used semistructured interviews and attribution theory to examine how 20 black and minority ethnic and 20 white senior managers from a UK government department made sense of significant career incidents in their leadership journeys. Template analysis was used to identify facilitators and barriers of career progression from causal explanations of these incidents. Although BME and white managers identified four common themes (visibility, networks, development and line manager support), they differed in how they made sense of formal and informal organizational processes to achieve career progression. The findings are used to theorize about the individual and organizational factors that contribute to the leadership journeys of minority ethnic employees.},

  abstract = {Missing data is a common problem in statistical analyses. To make use of information in data with incomplete observation, missing values can be imputed so that standard statistical methods can be used to analyze the data. Variables with missing values are often categorical and the missing pattern may not be monotone. Currently, commonly used imputation methods for data with a non-monotone missing pattern do not allow direct inclusion of categorical variables. Categorical variables are converted to numerical variables before imputation. For many applications, the imputed numerical values for those categorical variables must then be converted back to categorical values. However, this conversion introduces bias which can seriously affect subsequent analyses. In this paper, we propose two direct imputation methods for categorical variables with a non-monotone missing pattern: the direct imputation approach incorporated with the expectationmaximization algorithm and the direct imputation approach incorporated with a new algorithm: the imputation-maximization algorithm. Simulation studies show that both methods perform better than the method using variable conversion. An application to real data is provided to compare the direct imputation method and the method using variable conversion.},

The generalized Poisson (GP) regression model accommodates both overdispersion and underdispersion in count data modeling, and is an increasingly popular platform for modeling overdispersed count data. The Poisson model is one of the special cases in the collection of models which may be specified by GP regression. Thus, we may derive a test of overdispersion which compares the equi-dispersion Poisson model within the context of the more general GP regression model. The score test has an advantage over the likelihood ratio test (LRT) and over the Wald test in that the score test only requires that the parameter of interest be estimated under the null hypothesis (the Poisson model). Herein, we propose a score test for overdispersion based on the GP model (specifically the GP-2 model) and compare the power of the test with the LRT and Wald tests. A simulation study indicates the proposed score test based on asymptotic standard normal distribution is more appropriate in practical applications.},

  abstract = {Panel conditioning is an important source of measurement error unique to panel surveys. It refers to the phenomenon where participation in repeated interviews changes respondents' true behaviour, attitudes, or knowledge, or their reporting of their true behaviour, attitudes, and knowledge. A major weakness of (and a challenge to) the existing research on panel conditioning is its inability to distinguish between true change and change in reporting behavior. Existing studies are heavily reliant on assumptions and models when studying panel conditioning because they have no external gold-standard data source. This paper examines panel conditioning effects using data from four waves of a large German panel survey on labour market outcomes (PASS). Because administrative data on employment and unemployment benefit receipt status are available for nearly all respondents, we are able to separate panel conditioning due to change in true status and panel conditioning due to change in self-report of the true status without depending on assumptions. Our results show that PASS respondents are more likely to change their true behavioural status the longer they stay in the panel. In addition, they are less likely to misreport their behavioural status the longer they stay in the panel.},

Females are more likely to be overweight/obese in the Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, South-East Asia and the majority of countries in the Americas and Western Pacific but not in the most of the countries in Europe. These region-sex-ethnicity differences in prevalence may be a clue to the causes of the obesity epidemic. Epidemiological studies done in the USA, Europe, and Asia found that higher BMI was significantly associated with increased incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic stroke, but the association with hemorrhagic stroke incidence was not always consistent. The association of BMI with CAD and ischemic stroke was generally independent of known mediators, which would indicate the importance of controlling or preventing overweight/obesity for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.},

The importance of story-telling among the Native peoples is always present to shed light on how they explained their world.

In the past, right-wing, authoritarian regimes in Seoul fomented populist-nationalist contempt against Japan and North Korea, with biased and censored public discourse, but ignored public sentiments when negotiating with the target states. Since the democratic transition in the 1990s, South Korean governments no longer ignore public sentiments. Left-wing leaders and groups have pluralized public discourse about North Korea, exposing citizens to various views and information, and generated public support for Seoul to pursue rapprochement; but, no comparable groups generate counter-narratives about Japan. Instead, left-wing groups have accelerated negative portrayals and coopted state officials to censor dissenting views. Korean censorship follows illiberal trends in western democracies to ban certain public expressions considered offensive to historically victimized groups. The Korean case demonstrates that, without meaningful opposition and counter-narratives, activists for populist causes link with state power to infringe on the rights of domestic citizens and foreign entities. The remedy is liberalized public discourse that critically discusses complex realities.},

Comparable reactivity across age groups was observed for salivary cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), pre-ejection period (PEP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), whereas self-reported stress was higher in adults compared to children. In Study 2, eighty-four 7-8-year olds and eighty-six 12-15-year olds were randomly assigned to a standard or low-stress TSST-M condition. Cortisol and self-reported stress responses were higher in the standard compared to the low-stress condition. In contrast, sAA and PEP were higher in the low-stress condition and RSA responses were comparable between the two TSST-M conditions. In addition, age group differences emerged in Study 2, though never in conjunction with the TSST-M manipulation. To test, refine, and advance theory about the implications of stress for child development, laboratory tasks that manipulate and enable assessment of biobehavioral arousal in children are needed.},

In the first, theologically conservative congregations generate more embedded social ties (measured by number of friendships) than do non-conservative congregations, and more congregation friendships increase the likelihood of crossracial ties. In the second pathway, congregations not affiliated with historically major denominational families report higher levels of racial diversity, and high levels of congregation racial diversity increase the likelihood of cross-racial ties. Our key methodological innovation is to divide Evangelical congregations into two categories: those affiliated with the historically major families (Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian) and those not (e.g., Pentecostal, Seventh-Day Adventist). Christian groups that join theological conservatism and outsider (non-major) status generate high levels of friendships and racial diversity in their congregations, both of which contribute to cross-racial ties among white members. Analysis of survey data from a national probability sample of white Christians (2006 Faith Matters Survey) mostly supports our hypotheses.},

Extensive attention has been directed to analysis methods to adjust for the bias induced by missing observations. There is relatively little work on investigating the effects of covariate measurement error on estimation of the response parameters, especially on simultaneously accounting for the biases induced by both missing values and mismeasured covariates. It is not clear what the impact of ignoring measurement error is when analyzing longitudinal data with both missing observations and error-prone covariates. In this article, we study the effects of covariate measurement error on estimation of the response parameters for longitudinal studies. We develop an inference method that adjusts for the biases induced by measurement error as well as by missingness. The proposed method does not require the full specification of the distribution of the response vector but only requires modeling its mean and variance structures. Furthermore, the proposed method employs the so-called functional modeling strategy to handle the covariate process, with the distribution of covariates left unspecified. These features, plus the simplicity of implementation, make the proposed method very attractive. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic properties for the resulting estimators. With the proposed method, we conduct sensitivity analyses on a cohort data set arising from the Framingham Heart Study. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the impact of ignoring covariate measurement error and to assess the performance of the proposed method.},

The authors demonstrate how race theory intersects with other bodies of knowledge by examining discursive records such as travelogues, literature, and historiography; theoretical structures such as common sense, pseudoscientific racism, and Eurocentrism; social structures of class, advancement, and identity; and politico-economic structures of capitalism, colonialism, and law. Editors Joseph Young and Jana Evans Braziel aim to demonstrate the richness that emerges when race is taken into consideration and the misrepresentation of thought that results when it is not.},

  abstract = {The current system of publication in biomedical research provides a distorted view of the reality of scientific data that are generated in the laboratory and clinic. This system can be studied by applying principles from the field of economics. The ``winner's curse,'' a more general statement of publication bias, suggests that the small proportion of results chosen for publication are unrepresentative of scientists' repeated samplings of the real world. The self-correcting mechanism in science is retarded by the extreme imbalance between the abundance of supply (the output of basic science laboratories and clinical investigations) and the increasingly limited venues for publication (journals with sufficiently high impact). This system would be expected intrinsically to lead to the misallocation of resources. The scarcity of available outlets is artificial, based on the costs of printing in an electronic age and a belief that selectivity is equivalent to quality. Science is subject to great uncertainty: we cannot be confident now which efforts will ultimately yield worthwhile achievements. However, the current system abdicates to a small number of intermediates an authoritative prescience to anticipate a highly unpredictable future. In considering society's expectations and our own goals as scientists, we believe that there is a moral imperative to reconsider how scientific data are judged and disseminated.},

  abstract = {Multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM) plays a key role in studying measurement invariance and in group comparison. When population covariance matrices are deemed not equal across groups, the next step to substantiate measurement invariance is to see whether the sample covariance matrices in all the groups can be adequately fitted by the same factor model, called configural invariance. After configural invariance is established, cross-group equalities of factor loadings, error variances, and factor variancescovariances are then examined in sequence. With mean structures, cross-group equalities of intercepts and factor means are also examined. The established rule is that if the statistic at the current model is not significant at the level of .05, one then moves on to testing the next more restricted model using a chi-square-difference statistic. This article argues that such an established rule is unable to control either Type I or Type II errors. Analysis, an example, and Monte Carlo results show why and how chi-squaredifference tests are easily misused. The fundamental issue is that chi-square-difference tests are developed under the assumption that the base model is sufficiently close to the population, and a nonsignificant chi-square statistic tells little about how good the model is. To overcome this issue, this article further proposes that null hypothesis testing in multigroup SEM be replaced by equivalence testing, which allows researchers to effectively control the size of misspecification before moving on to testing a more restricted model. R code is also provided to facilitate the applications of equivalence testing for multigroup SEM.},

Methods The Pubmed, Chinese Biomedical, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, Wanfang and Google Scholar databases were searched to January 2011 to identify relevant articles. Data of eligible citations were extracted by two reviewers. All analyses were performed using Stata 10.0. Results Forty-nine articles (including 28 739 MSM subjects) met the selection criteria. Aggregated findings indicated that the estimated prevalence of bisexual behaviour among MSM in China is 31.2\% (95\% CI 28.1\% to 34.5\%). HIV and syphilis prevalences were 5.4\% and 11.4\%, respectively, among MSM engaging in bisexual behaviour and 3.8\% and 9.3\% among MSM only having sex with men. HIV prevalence among MSM engaging in sex with both men and women was significantly higher than in those who only have sex with men (OR 1.30; 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.62; p{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.02). Conclusion There is a high prevalence of bisexual behaviour among MSM in China and bisexual behaviour is significantly associated with increased HIV infection risk. The results of this meta-analysis highlight a critical pattern of HIV transmission among MSM in China and indicate that targeted interventions aimed at encouraging safe sex practices and promoting societal and family acceptance of MSM are urgently needed.},

This gain in efficiency can be quite large if "independent" variables in different equations are not highly correlated and if disturbance terms in different equations are highly correlated. Further, tests of the hypothesis that all regression equation coefficient vectors are equal, based on "micro" and "macro" data, are described. If this hypothesis is accepted, there will be no aggregation bias. Finally, the estimation procedure and the "micro-test" for aggregation bias are applied in the analysis of annual investment data, 1935-1954, for two firms.},

  abstract = {Background Obesity is a well recognized risk factor for various chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to shed light on the patterns of overweight and obesity in sub-Saharan Africa, with special interest in differences between the urban poor and the urban non-poor. The specific goals were to describe trends in overweight and obesity among urban women; and examine how these trends vary by education and household wealth. Methods The paper used Demographic and Health Surveys data from seven African countries where two surveys had been carried out with an interval of at least 10 years between them. Among the countries studied, the earliest survey took place in 1992 and the latest in 2005. The dependent variable was body mass index coded as: Not overweight/obese; Overweight; Obese. The key covariates were time lapse between the two surveys; woman's education; and household wealth. Control variables included working status, age, marital status, parity, and country. Multivariate ordered logistic regression in the context of the partial proportional odds model was used. Results Descriptive results showed that the prevalence of urban overweight/obesity increased by nearly 35\% during the period covered. The increase was higher among the poorest (+50\%) than among the richest (+7\%). Importantly, there was an increase of 45-50\% among the non-educated and primary-educated women, compared to a drop of 10\% among women with secondary education or higher. In the multivariate analysis, the odds ratio of the variable time lapse was 1.05 (p {$<$} 0.01), indicating that the prevalence of overweight/obesity increased by about 5\% per year on average in the countries in the study. While the rate of change in urban overweight/obesity did not significantly differ between the poor and the rich, it was substantially higher among the non-educated women than among their educated counterparts. Conclusion Overweight and obesity are on the rise in Africa and might take epidemic proportions in the near future.
