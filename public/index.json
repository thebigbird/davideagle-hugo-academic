This study demonstrates the utility of this theory in an empirical case study of disparities in earnings, job quality, and advancement among clergy in the United Methodist Church. Despite the preferences articulated by the Black clergy, the formal organizational policies that ban race as a consideration in appointment making were decoupled from managerial practices; thus clergy and congregations were matched on race. Because of local control over salaries and major resource disparities between congregations, race matching led to Black-White disparities in pay, advancement, working conditions, and professional support. The most promising remedy is a common salary scale with a more comprehensive redistribution process to address resources inequalities across congregations.","tags":[],"title":"Reproducing inequality in a formally anti-racist organization: the case of racialized career pathways in the United Methodist Church","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erin F.

Given the physical health problems faced by clergy, understanding where physical health falls within the priorities of seminary students, the ways students conceptualize physical health, and how seminary students do or do not attend to their physical health in the years immediately prior to becoming clergy, can inform intervention development for both seminary students and clergy. Moreover, understanding and shaping the health practices of aspiring clergy may be particularly impactful, with cascading effects, as clergy serve as important role models for their congregants. Drawing on 36 in-depth, qualitative interviews with first-year seminary students, this study examines the complex dynamics between religious frameworks related to physical health, explicit intentions to maintain healthy practices, and reported physical health behaviors. Our findings suggest that even students who deploy religious frameworks in relation to their physical health—and who, as a result, possess positive intentions to implement and maintain healthy behaviors—often report being unable to live up to their aspirations, especially in the face of barriers to health practices posed by the seminary program itself. After reviewing these findings, we offer suggestions for physical health focused interventions, including action and coping planning, which could be implemented at seminaries to reduce the intention–behavior gap and improve clergy health","tags":[],"title":"Seminary students and physical health: beliefs, behaviors, and barriers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Logan C.

The intervention and waitlist control groups will be recruited by email. The interventions offered are specifically targeted to clergy preference and include mindfulness-based stress reduction, Daily Examen, and stress inoculation training. Surveys will be conducted at 0, 12, and 24 weeks with heart rate data collected at 0 and 12 weeks.

This shift likely impacted congregational finances, which are primarily driven by individual donations. Initial research has suggested that there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the financial impact on congregations, but there has been scant research examining how pastors and congregations are managing finances during this period. Purpose: This research examines the impact of COVID-19 and its associated restrictions on congregational finances and the strategies pastors used to adapt their church’s finances to the health restrictions. Methods: We conducted in-depth, qualitative interviews with 50 pastors in the North Carolina and Western North Carolina Conferences of the United Methodist Church appointed to 70 congregations. Using applied thematic analysis, we analyzed transcripts at both the pastor and congregation-level to identify similarities and differences in financial impact, financial strategies, and pastor experiences during the pandemic. Results: Most congregations reported small decreases in giving that were offset by federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and other grants from the denomination. Some congregations, mostly urban and fairly large, reported significant increases in giving, while several other, predominantly small congregations, reported their church’s finances had been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Even in cases where the net impact of the pandemic was small or non-existent, pastors were forced to adopt a host of new strategies to manage finances. In general, small and large congregations experienced and responded to the financial impact of the pandemic very differently.and Implications. Conclusions: This research suggests that the pandemic’s impact on congregational finances were more than just on the bottom line. And while most churches weathered the economic challenges without severe impacts, questions remain as to the long-term impact of the pandemic on church finances.","tags":[],"title":"The financial impacts of COVID-19 on United Methodist Churches in North Carolina: a qualitative study of pastors’ perspectives and strategies.","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Pastoral Care"],"content":"This summer, in an article in The Christian Century, Stanley Hauerwas and Will Willimon write about the dangers of providing pastoral care. This piece is deeply flawed.\nA pull-quote from Willimon proclaims,\n Better than self-care is to answer the call to care about what Christ cares about.\n Is promoting self-care just an outgrowth of a narcissistic, Western viewpoint? Early in my years at Duke, I often saw Hauerwas jogging around campus. What would Willimon have to say about such a blatant show of narcissism?\nFrom our research at Clergy Health, we have found pastors are at high risk for developing diabetes. Diabetes is a serious disease that often leads to permanent nerve damage, vision loss and premature death. Isn’t helping pastors to engage in habits that prevent them from developing diabetes simply a good idea? Our food system and way of life has become a diabetes-producing factory. Why shouldn’t we equip pastors with the tools to resist the power of the modern industrial food system? I agree that Christians are called to care about what Christ cares about. The witness of scripture is pretty clear: Christ cares about our bodies.\nOf course, this can go too far. Of course, we can become self-obsessed and self-absorbed. Of course, there is a cult of well being that ignores the basic fact of life that one day we all will die.\nJessica Young Brown says it well,\n This work demands that we make time to move toward balance—to evaluate and reevaluate our priorities and boundaries, and to take care of our emotional health. It is not a luxury; it is an act of stewardship that honors what God has given us.\n Willimon continues,\n Years later, as a bishop, I became troubled that many contemporary pastors aspired only to be obsequious pastoral caregivers and hand-holders—the pastor as the empathetic helping healer who goes for the low-hanging fruit by encouraging people to display and then lick their wounds.\n This is wrong, plain and simple. It’s a sound-bite that ignores the reality of pastoral ministry. Again, it’s such an un-pastoral thing to say. According to Hauerwas,\n pastoral care has become obsessed with the personal wounds of people in advanced industrial societies who have discovered that their lives lack meaning.\n Really?\nWhen I was a pastor, I remember sitting with a woman in my office who just found out her husband had been engaged in a years-long affair with another woman. What was my proper reponse? Stop licking your wounds. Stop taking yourself so seriously. Had I really succumbed to the modern obsession with our personal wounds? What exactly is wrong with pastors being empathetic, helping healers? What is a pastor if not someone who will sit with others in their pain and wait for resurrection on the other side of crucifixion? Isn’t that what it means to “witness to Christ’s cross and resurrection”?\nAfter a long and familiar rant about the emptiness of modern North American psychological culture (as if there is such a thing as a unified North American culture, or that psychology is merely one thing), Hauerwas tells the reader:\n When people expect their pastor to help them display and then heal their wounds, the Christian faith is reduced to a technique for gaining control over your life so you can be happy. I hope their pastor would ask, “Why would you come to me for that?”\n I am a survivor of sexual abuse. Imagine I disclose this to my pastor and ask for help finding a path back to happiness and she says, “Why would you come to me for that?”\nTrauma has devastating consequences for individuals and society. Often, the consequence of trauma is survivors have literally lost control of their lives. The church ought to provide a place for survivors to confront their pasts without becoming consumed by them. The resurrection is witness to the fact that the worst of human evil will not ultimately triumph. To so many survivors of trauma happiness is elusive and lies always beyond reach. Is moving people towards happiness such an unworthy goal?\nWillimon continues this thread with the following pastoral advice:\n The church is the field hospital where those who, having been wounded by their participation in Christ’s mission, are bandaged up so they can be sent right back into the front lines of the battle.\n Is pastoral care really about bandaging our wounds so we can be sent back into battle? I hope not. Many—perhaps most—of our wounds come from the simple fact that we live in a world that is still inhabited by Death. I cannot defeat Death; we cannot defeat Death. It will consume me. Pastoral theology (can Christian theology ever not be pastoral theology?) ought to acknowledge that humans are powerless in the face of Death.\nAs the 17th Century Latin hymn set to the musical genius of Palestrina proclaims:\n The strife is o’er, the battle done;\nthe victory of life is won;\nthe song of triumph has begun.\nAlleluia!\nThe powers of death have done their worst,\nbut Christ their legions has dispersed.\nLet shouts of holy joy …","date":1633392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633463207,"objectID":"21c70c22ffdd2cc234836b54e6c04915","permalink":"https://xenodochial-yonath-5a40d0.netlify.app/post/why-hauerwas-and-willimon-are-wrong-about-pastoral-care/","publishdate":"2021-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/why-hauerwas-and-willimon-are-wrong-about-pastoral-care/","section":"post","summary":"This summer, in an article in The Christian Century, Stanley Hauerwas and Will Willimon write about the dangers of providing pastoral care.

Compared to baseline, at 3 and 9 months post-workshop, participants reported an increase in Sabbath-keeping. In adjusted random effects and Poisson models, compared to not changing Sabbath-keeping frequency, increasing Sabbath-keeping was related to only one outcome: greater feelings of personal accomplishment at work. Decreasing Sabbath-keeping was related to worse anxiety symptoms, lower spiritual well-being in ministry scores, and a higher probability of having less than flourishing mental health. For four outcomes, there were no significant associations with changes in Sabbath-keeping over time.

While several surveys have attempted to describe how pastors and congregations responded to COVID-19, these provide a relatively thin picture of how COVID-19 is impacting religious life. There is scant qualitative data describing the lived reality of religious leaders and communities during the pandemic.  Purpose and methods: This paper provides a more detailed look at how pastors and congregations experienced and responded to COVID-19 and its associated restrictions in the early period of the pandemic. To do so, we draw from 26 in-depth interviews with church-appointed United Methodist pastors conducted between June and August 2020. Pastors were asked to describe how their ministry changed as a result of COVID-19 and interviews were analyzed using applied thematic analysis approaches to identify the most common emergent themes.  Results: Pastors reported that COVID-19 fundamentally unsettled routine ways of doing ministry. This disruption generated both challenges and opportunities for clergy and their congregations. In the findings, we describe how clergy responded in key areas of ministry-worship and pastoral care-and analyze how the pandemic is (re)shaping the way that clergy understood their role as pastors and envisioned the future of the Church. We argue for the value of examining the pandemic as an \\\"unsettled\\\" cultural period (Swidler 1986) in which religious leaders found creative ways to (re)do ministry in the context of social distancing. Rather than starting from scratch, we found that pastors drew from and modified existing symbolic and practical tools to fit pandemic-related constraints on religious life. Notably, however, we found that \\\"redoing\\\" ministry was easier and more effective in some areas (worship) than others (pastoral care).  Conclusions and implications: The impact of COVID-19 on pastors and congregations is complex and not fully captured by survey research. This study provides a baseline for investigating similarities and differences in the responses of pastors within and across denominations and traditions. It also provides a baseline for assessing whether changes in ministry implemented during the early stages of the pandemic remain in place in the post-COVID world.","tags":[],"title":"Pastoral ministry in unsettled times: A qualitative study of the experiences of clergy during the COVID-19 pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

This adaption has participants use wearable, self-administered ECG monitors received and returned via mail. Fifty participants were recruited to take part in a pilot study evaluating stress-reduction interventions and completed the iTSST at two occasions separated by approximately 12 weeks. Perceived stress and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured during both administrations of the iTSST. Forty-one participants completed both assessments and were included in the set of analyses. Both administrations were characterized by an increase in self-reported stress and reduction in self-reported relaxation from the resting phase to the speech task, which returned to baseline during recovery. In terms of HRV, we observed a significant parasympathetic response to the iTSST in 90% of participants, evidenced by a decrease in RMSSD and increase in heart rate from resting to the speech task, which recovered during the recovery phase. In terms of repeatability, there was little evidence of habituation and the iTSST elicited a stress response during both the initial administration and the 12-week follow-up.

In addition, contrary to popular conceptions, there is little evidence attrition is particularly high in the first 5 years of congregational ministry.

Frameworks on employee mental health incorporate elements of both enjoyment/difficulties and values (i.e., hedonic and eudaimonic elements), yet existing studies focus on caregivers’ mental illness and overlook their specific work activities. Methods We collected diary activity log, survey, and interview data from caregivers from five geographic locations: Hyderabad, India; Nagaland, India; Ethiopia; Kenya; and Cambodia. We coded and calculated the amount of time spent on five frequent activities: cleaning, cooking, caring for children, supervising children, and informal educational activities. We calculated the mean scores of perceived importance, meaningfulness, enjoyment, and unpleasantness for each of the five activities by geographic location. Results A total of 82 participants completed surveys and activity logs, and 69 of them participated in interviews. Mean time spent per day for the five activities combined ranged from 4.4 h (Nagaland) to 9.0 h (Ethiopia). Cooking and cleaning constituted a large portion of caregivers’ days, ranging from 0.8 h per caregiver per day in Nagaland to 4.7 h in Cambodia, and informal educational activities (such as advising, teaching children their letters, and teaching from religious texts) constituted the least time, ranging from 0.1 h per caregiver per day in Hyderabad to 1.1 h in Nagaland. Participants rated all activities high in importance, with cleaning being relatively lower. Overall, enjoyment scores were lower than importance and meaningfulness scores. Informal educational activities had the highest enjoyment scores in three locations, whereas supervising children did in two locations.

Discussion OSC caregivers consider several regular activities to be very important and meaningful. Enjoyment may be improved through additional support in child behavior management or spending more time providing informal educational activities; at minimum, caregiver mental health should be considered before turning informal educational activities over to volunteers.","tags":["\"Mental health\"","\"Caregiving\"","\"Occupational health\"","\"Orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC)\"","\"Positive emotions\""],"title":"Enjoyment and meaning in daily activities among caregivers of orphaned and separated children in four countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rae Jean Proeschold-Bell","Dori M Steinberg","Jia Yao","David E Eagle","Timothy W Smith","Grace Y Cai","Elizabeth L Turner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630115815,"objectID":"3b0b30a329a4f16722ec170b82966469","permalink":"https://xenodochial-yonath-5a40d0.netlify.app/publication/proeschold-bell-using-holistic-health-2020/","publishdate":"2021-08-28T01:56:55.77798Z","relpermalink":"/publication/proeschold-bell-using-holistic-health-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Weight-loss maintenance is essential to sustain the health benefits of weight loss. Studies with lower intensity intervention supports under real-world conditions are lacking. This study examined changes in weight and cardiometabolic biomarkers among Spirited Life participants following initial 12-month weight loss at 12–24 months and 24–42 months. A total of 719 clergy received a wellness intervention, including a 10-week online weight-loss program in the first 12 months and monthly health coaching throughout 24 months. Mean changes in weight, blood pressure, high-density lipoproteins, and triglycerides were estimated using random effects linear models, accounting for repeated measures. Weight was additionally analyzed in subsamples stratified by body mass index (BMI). At baseline, 17.1% of participants had BMI \u003c 25 kg/m2 and 11.8% had BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2. Mean 12-month weight loss was −2.4 kg (95% CI: −2.8 kg, −2.1 kg). On average, at 42 months, participants regained weight but did not exceed baseline (−0.5 kg, 95% CI: −1.2 kg, 0.2 kg), improvements in triglycerides were completely sustained (−13.9 mg/dL, 95% CI: −18.6 mg/dL, −9.2 mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure improvements remained significant (−1.9 mmHg, 95% CI: −3.0 mmHg, −0.9 mmHg). Participants with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 lost significantly more weight that was sustained at 42 months (−5.8 kg, 95% CI: −8.9 kg, −2.7 kg). The Spirited Life wellness intervention produced weight loss and, for participants with higher levels of obesity, sustained weight-loss maintenance. The intervention was effective for long-term prevention of weight gain among participants with BMI of 25 to ≤40 kg/m2, through 42 months. Wellness interventions such as Spirited Life should be considered for adoption.","tags":[],"title":"Using a holistic health approach to achieve weight-loss maintenance: results from the spirited life intervention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Celia F.

Many older adults worldwide are continuing to work past traditional retirement age, raising the question whether older adults experience depression, anxiety, or burnout at the same or greater levels as younger workers, and whether there are differences by age in these levels over time.Design/setting/participants:Longitudinal survey of 1161 currently employed US clergy followed every 6–12 months for up to 66 months.Measurements:Depression was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Anxiety was measured using the anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Burnout symptoms were assessed using the three components of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and sense of personal accomplishment (PA).Results:Older participants had lower scores of depression, anxiety, EE, and DP and higher levels of PA over time compared to younger adults. Levels of EE decreased for older working adults, while not significantly changing over time for those younger. DP symptoms decreased over time among those 55 years or older but increased among those 25–54 years.Conclusions:Older working adults may have higher levels of resilience and be able to balance personal life with their occupation as well as may engage in certain behaviors that increase social support and, for clergy, spiritual well-being that may decrease stress in a way that allows these older adults to appear to tolerate working longer without poorer mental health outcomes.","tags":["\"burnout\"","\"depression\"","\"anxiety\"","\"elderly\"","\"trajectories\""],"title":"Age differences in trajectories of depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms in a population with a high likelihood of persistent occupational distress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

We conducted qualitative interviews of 69 caregivers in four countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Cambodia, and India (Hyderabad and Nagaland), and across four religious traditions: Christian (Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant), Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu. We asked respondents to describe the importance of religion for their becoming a caregiver, the way in which religion has helped them make sense of why children are orphans, and how religion helps them face the challenges of their occupation. Using qualitative descriptive analysis, three major themes emerged. Respondents discussed how religion provided a strong motivation for their work, reported that religious institutions were often the way in which they were introduced to caregiving as an occupation, and spoke of the ways religious practices sustain them in their work. They rarely advanced religion as an explanation for why OVC exist—only when pressed did they offer explicitly religious accounts. This study has implications for OVC care, including the importance of engaging religious institutions to support caregivers, the significance of attending to local religious context, and the vital need for research outside of Christian contexts.","tags":["\"Buddhism\"","\"Caregivers\"","\"Christianity\"","\"Hinduism\"","\"International\"","\"Islam\"","\"Orphaned and vulnerable children\"","\"Religion\"","\"Religion and occupational well-being\""],"title":"Religion and caregiving for orphans and vulnerable children: a qualitative study of caregivers across four religious traditions and five global contexts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Warren A.

Research has focused on the absence or presence of mental health problems, such as depression, in caregivers. However, positive mental health – defined as the presence of positive emotions, psychological functioning, and social functioning – likely prevents depression and in caregivers may benefit children more than the mere absence of mental health problems. Little attention has been given to how caregivers sustain positive mental health, particularly when doing challenging work in impoverished settings. Objective The study's objective was to determine what successful caregivers of orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) in diverse countries do to sustain their positive mental health. Methods Using a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study design, trained local interviewers recruited a convenience sample of OVC caregivers through residential care institutions from five geographic regions (Kenya; Ethiopia; Cambodia; Hyderabad, India; and Nagaland, India). Participants completed surveys and in-depth interviews about strategies used to sustain their mental health over time or improve it during challenging times. Results Sixty-nine OVC caregivers from 28 residential care institutions participated. Positive mental health survey scores were high. We organized the strategies named into six categories ordered from most to least frequently named: Religious Practices; Engaging in Caregiving; Social Support; Pleasurable Activities; Emotion Regulation; and Removing Oneself from Work. Prayer and reading religious texts arose as common strategies. Participants reported promoting positive emotions by focusing on their work's meaning and playing with children. The similar findings across diverse regions were striking. Some differences included more emphasis on emotion control in Ethiopia; listening to music/singing in Kenya and Hyderabad; and involving children in the tasks the participants enjoyed less (e.g., cleaning) in Cambodia. Conclusions Under real-world conditions, small daily activities appeared to help sustain positive mental health. In addition, fostering structures that allow caregivers to engage regularly in rewarding caregiving tasks may be an affordable and scalable idea which could potentially benefit caregivers, children, and employers.","tags":[],"title":"Caring and thriving: an international qualitative study of caregivers of orphaned and vulnerable children and strategies to sustain positive mental health","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

First of all, the proportion of Roman Catholics in the United States has stayed relatively steady over this period. While Latin American immigration has brought a lot of new Catholics to the United States, this has been offset by losses among the non-hispanic Catholic population.\nSecond, there has been a very steep rise in the number of people claiming no religious affiliation. Non-affiliates were a pretty steady 5-8% of the US population from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. The proportion of nones has climbed steeply since then, reaching a high of 25% of the US population, making them the second largest “religious” group in the United States. They could very well surpass Catholics by the time the next wave of GSS data are released.\nThe higher proportion Black Protestant in 1972 is probably due to some sort of artifact in the GSS data. There seems to be a lower proportion of Conservative Protestants that year as well. This blip is also found on other plots of GSS reltrad data, here, for example.\nThird, Mainline Protestants are in free fall. They are now about 12% of the US population, down about 20 points from their peak in the early 1970s. Conservative Protestants made some gains in the mid-1980s to mid-1990s (probably due to people leaving mainline denominations over cultural issues), but are also declining. They are down about 10 points from their high in the early 1990s.\nAlso important is that the “Other” religion category is steadily climbing, and has reached a high of about 5% of the US population. The proportion of the population identifying as Black Protestants remained fairly steady over this period, but recently has begun to decline. This is likely due to more Black Protestants identifying with Conservative Protestant denominations rather that historically Black denominations.\n","date":1547510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547510400,"objectID":"195795fbffdcf906a0b1a2a3978dfa6c","permalink":"https://xenodochial-yonath-5a40d0.netlify.app/post/reltrad-in-the-us/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reltrad-in-the-us/","section":"post","summary":"Religious affliation has changed significantly in the United States since 1972.

Overall, analyses revealed perceived support had a weak association with received support. Greater perceived support had a significant relationship with lower depressive symptoms. In contrast, greater received support had only a small relationship with lower depressive symptoms, which was fully mediated by perceived support. Our results raise questions about the effectiveness of many clergy social support interventions, which often aim to boost the quality and/or quantity of received social support.

Intervention: The 2-year intervention consisted of personal goal setting and encouragement to engage in monthly health coaching, an online weight loss intervention, a small grant, and three workshops delivering stress management and theological content supporting healthy behaviors. Participants were not blinded to intervention. Main outcome measures: Trial outcomes were metabolic syndrome (primary) and self-reported stress and depressive symptoms (secondary). Intervention effects were estimated in 2016 in an intention-to-treat framework using generalized estimating equations with adjustment for baseline level of the outcome and follow-up time points. Log-link Poisson generalized estimating equations with robust SEs was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for binary outcomes; mean differences were used for continuous/score outcomes. Results: Baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.9% and depression was 11.4%. The 12-month intervention effect showed a beneﬁt for metabolic syndrome (PR¼0.86, 95% CI¼0.79, 0.94, po0.001). This beneﬁt was sustained at 24 months of intervention (PR¼0.88; 95% CI¼0.78, 1.00, p¼0.04). There was no signiﬁcant effect on depression or stress scores. Conclusions: The Spirited Life intervention improved metabolic syndrome prevalence in a population of U.S. Christian clergy and sustained improvements during 24 months of intervention. These ﬁndings offer support for long-duration behavior change interventions and population-level interventions that allow participants to set their own health goals.","tags":[],"title":"A 2-year holistic health and stress intervention: results of an RCT in clergy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy W.

Contrary to this position, this research demonstrates that megachurches enjoy a long history in Protestantism. An important example from the 16th Century Huguenot architect Jacques Perret reveals an early Protestant vision for a large, multi-functional worship space. Soon after, this vision became realized in bricks and mortar. Revivalism and the Institutional Church Movement of the 19th and early 20th Centuries provide further connections between megachurches and the past. Revivalism provided the motivation for Protestants to go out and reach the masses, and the Institutional Church Movement provided the infrastructure to attract, convert, and nurture them. The demographic shifts that occurred following WWII led to the proliferation of churches in post-war America. This meant that large churches became increasingly visible, but journalists and social commentators mistook their increase in prevalence for lack of historical precedent. Pastors and other leaders, capitalizing on the appeal of innovation, reinforced this view.

This study adds to current knowledge by examining the impact of British Columbia’s Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), established in 1973, which severely restricts subdivision and nonagricultural uses for more than 4.7 million hectares of farmland. To determine the extent to which the ALR preserves farmland by reducing or removing the development option, a multilevel hedonic pricing model is used to estimate the impact of land use, geographic, and zoning characteristics on farmland value near the capital city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Using sales data from 1974 through 2008, the model demonstrates a changing ALR impact over time that varies considerably by improved and unimproved land types. In 2008, landowners paid 19% less for the typical improved farmland parcel within the ALR versus that outside it. This suggests that would-be developers expect permanency in the zoning law, and prefer non-ALR zoned land. However, ALR land that is unimproved has a premium of 55%, suggesting that this land is more valuable for agriculture than for development. Farmland located closer to the city or the commuting highway commands a premium if it has a residence on it, with a residence also explaining why smaller agricultural properties sell at higher prices. However, it appears that zoning by itself is insufﬁcient to protect farmland; other policies likely need to be implemented in conjunction with zoning to protect agricultural land.","tags":[],"title":"Farmland protection and agricultural land values at the urban-rural fringe: British Columbia’s agricultural land reserve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

However, contemporary research in the field recognizes that race, SES, and gender interact to create complicated systems of inequality that go beyond conventional models of stratification. Increasingly, studies add categories such as religion and nativity to the mix and uncover even more complex patterns of inequality, ones that rarely fit conventional explanations for stratification outcomes, particularly for women (Fitzgerald and Glass 2008, 2012; Glass and Jacobs 2005; Lehrer 1999a; Sherkat and Darnell 1999). Consider these examples: Education is highly correlated with U.S. women's employment and earnings (England, Garcia-Beaulieu, and Ross 2004), but is much more so for native-born white and black women than for immigrant women (Read and Cohen 2007). Religion is negatively associated with women's human capital acquisition among conservative Christians (Lehrer 1999b), whereas the opposite is true among U.S. Jews (Gold 2002), and among Arab Americans, women evidence a pattern of high educational attainment, but very low labor force participation (Read and Oselin 2008). These patterns can create theoretical and empirical conundrums for researchers focused on the relationship between any single identity (e.g., race, class, gender) and social inequality. In this chapter, we examine where the presence of multiple group identities results in status attainment outcomes that do not fit neatly within conventional stratification models. We use Arab American women as a case study. This group provides a useful case because it lies at the intersection of religion and ethnicity, where the cultural dynamics shaping women's achievements are especially acute (Read 2004). Arab American women also constitute a population that exhibits a paradoxical pattern of high educational attainment but low employment (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2000). They provide a rich repository of information to examine how multiple identity categories intersect to shape outcomes.","tags":[],"title":"Intersectionality and identity: an exploration of Arab-American women","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

The other portion of this decline is attributable to eroding attendance rates among Catholics, particularly older Catholics, and Protestants in Que´bec. Attendance rates for Protestants outside of Que´bec show signs of increase. The reported increase in weekly attendance in Canada by the Project Canada surveys and cited by Bibby as a possible indicator of a religious renaissance is revealed as an artifact in the data due to an oversample of Protestants.

To illustrate this argument, the analysis draws on data from the 2006 Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) to assess how race, gender, and religion interact to produce different levels of attitude and behavior incongruencies on key issues of the day, specifically conservative social values and voting behaviors.

This mode of theological argumentation has a long history in the tradition of natural theology, which assumes that divine direction (and even divine speech) is inherent in creaturely capacities. In this article, I will demonstrate that New Testament scholarship is agreed that in Romans 1:18-32 (the key NT text on the issue), Paul is not making an argument per se against homosexuality. Instead, this passage fits within the larger claim that he is trying to make throughout the book of Romans about Jew-Gentile relations. What Paul condemns here is the human propensity to judge others based on supposedly intrinsic qualities. He is using a stereotypical Jewish understanding of Gentiles, and turning it back against those who would argue for some special innate characteristic within Jews that makes them special and within Gentiles that makes them depraved.","tags":["\"🔍No DOI found\""],"title":"Pneumatological ecclesiology and same-sex marriage: A non-essentialist approach using the work of Eugene Rogers and John Zizioulas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David E.

However, I challenge Weaver’s claim. I contend that Mennonite theologians would find better resources for articulating a nonviolent approach in the work of Anthony Bartlett in his recent book, Cross Purposes: The Violent Grammar of Christian Atonement.

Well, today is your lucky day.\nThe measure of religious affiliation described in Steensland et al 2000, otherwise known as reltrad, remains the most popular way to categorize people religiously in the United States. Early development of the measure was done by Corwin Smidt, Bud Kellstedt and James Guth during their annual seminars on measuring religion offered at Calvin College. The reltrad crowd continues to think their measure is pretty good Woodberry 2012. A reltrad for African Americans has been developed - this is required reading for those who use reltrad in their research Shelton 2017.\nUp until now, the code to create the reltrad variable from the General Social Survey has only been available in PDF. Stata code for reltrad is available from Lifeway Research. Lifeway also published R code. Ryan Burge has Stata code up on Github: https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad.\nHere, I am providing a link to my repository with an R translation of the code that is more reproducible. I apply this to the 1972-2016 GSS combined data file. Note that I do incorporate the corrections suggested by [@stetzerReltradCodingProblems2016].\nUsing Kieran Healy’s gssr package, the sample code loads the gss datafile, dumps the oversamples, and then calls the function I’ve written (now mostly in dplyr) to create a reltrad variable. The lives here.\nAfter the code is run, the results can be quickly tabulated.
