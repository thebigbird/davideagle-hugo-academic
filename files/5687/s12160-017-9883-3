A small, methodologically limited literature suggests that Met-S and depression are reciprocally related over time, an association that could contribute to their overlapping influences on morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.\nUsing a refined approach to the measurement of Met-S as a continuous latent variable comprising continuous components, this study tested the prospective associations between Met-S and depression.\nThis study of 1114 clergy included four annual assessments of depressive symptoms and Met-S components. Standard methods were used to measure Met-S risk factors, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 was used to assess depressive symptoms. We used confirmatory factor analysis to verify the structure of Met-S and depression and structural equation modeling to quantify the prospective relationships.\nThe statistical models confirmed the validity of quantifying Met-S as a continuous latent variable, replicated previous evidence of a concurrent association, and indicated a significant prospective association of initial depressive symptoms with subsequent Met-S. Initial Met-S was at most only weakly associated with subsequent depressive symptoms, and the former prospective effect was significantly larger. Associations of depressive symptoms and Met-S were significant for both men and women, but somewhat stronger among men.\nResults support representation of Met-S as a continuous latent variable. The association of initial depressive symptoms with later Met-S suggests that interventions addressing these correlated risk factors may prove useful in preventive efforts.","context":{"all":{"count":11431442,"mean":7.3209468578684,"rank":6154915,"pct":44,"higher_than":5134776},"journal":{"count":960,"mean":11.165735140772,"rank":590,"pct":36,"higher_than":352},"similar_age_3m":{"count":257947,"mean":13.939643654098,"rank":115039,"pct":53,"higher_than":138551},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":27,"mean":18.582538461538,"rank":16,"pct":40,"higher_than":11}},"authors":["Timothy W.
