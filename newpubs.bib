	abstract = {Objective This systematic review aims to summarize the current body of evidence concerning the prevalence of obesity among clergy (i.e., the officially designated leaders of a religious group) in the United States. Method From November 2022 to February 2023, five databases, one data repository, and gray matter were searched for articles and data sources. The search was restricted to articles published or raw data collected from 2001 to 2021. Study quality was assessed with a template, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I2{\textbackslash} I{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash} statistic. The protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022376592). Results Forty-seven studies of clergy obesity involving 35,064 individuals were eligible. The pooled prevalence estimate of obesity across studies was 34.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 32.5–37.2). Obesity prevalence was found to be increasing over time and to vary considerably between clergy from different religious traditions. Compared to national estimates, from 2005 onwards, obesity prevalence was higher than in the US adult population.},

	abstract = {RELTRAD is a major religious taxonomy used by a large number of researchers. Although criticisms have been raised about its utility, improving the algorithm to capture contemporary religious dynamics is important given its widespread use. The present RELTRAD taxonomy classifies more religiously active nondenominational respondents as Conservative Protestants and codes the remainder as missing data. A growing number of Americans indicate they are either nondenominational or only Christian or Protestant, which means using RELTRAD in its existing form codes a nonrandom and increasingly large number of respondents with a missing value for religious affiliation (growing from 2 percent to 5 percent of the US General Social Survey (GSS) sample between 2000 and 2018). Using a machine learning algorithm to predict the likely religious tradition of nondenominational respondents, we demonstrate the shortcomings of this approach and introduce a new coding scheme, RELTRAD2, which classifies nondenominational respondents who report a Black racial identity as Black Protestant, non-Black respondents who never attend religious services as Mainline Protestant, and the remainder as Conservative Protestant. Code to derive RELTRAD2 from the GSS is provided.},

            Maintaining healthy behaviors is challenging. Based upon previous reports that in North Carolina (NC), USA, overweight/obese clergy lost weight during a two-year religiously tailored health intervention, we described trajectories of diet, physical activity, and sleep. We investigated whether behavior changes were associated with weight and use of health-promoting theological messages. Improvements were observed in sleep, calorie-dense food intake, and physical activity, with the latter two associated with weight loss. While theological messages were well-retained, their relationship with behaviors depended on the specific message, behavior, and timing. Findings offer insights into weight loss mechanisms, including the role of theological messages in religiously tailored health interventions.},
