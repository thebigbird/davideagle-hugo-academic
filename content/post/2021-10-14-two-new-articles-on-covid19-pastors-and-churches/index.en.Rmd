I have just co-authored two recent papers on the impact of COVID19 on pastors and churches. They both appear in the *The Review of Religious Research.* Download them today:

- [The Financial Impacts of COVID-19 on United Methodist Churches in North Carolina: a Qualitative Study of Pastorsâ€™ Perspectives and Strategies](https://rdcu.be/czoQP)

- [Pastoral Ministry in Unsettled Times: A Qualitative Study of the Experiences of Clergy During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://rdcu.be/csZpE)
