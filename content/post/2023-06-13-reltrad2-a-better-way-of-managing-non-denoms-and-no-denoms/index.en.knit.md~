Joshua Gaghan and I have just finished a manuscript where we outline an improved way to assign people in the General Social Survey who have either no-denomination or are non-denominational. In this post, I share this new approach and plot the trend in the GSS over time using classic RELTRAD and our new, improved version.

Using the General Social Survey, people can be categorized into broad religious families based on the denomination/religious group with which they identify. The problem with this approach is that some people state they are non-denominational, some that they don't know/have a denomination and others that they are interdenominational. Under the older reltrad taxonomy \[\\\@steenslandMeasureAmericanReligion2000\].
