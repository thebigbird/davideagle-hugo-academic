abstract: 'Weight-loss maintenance is essential to sustain the health benefits of
  weight loss. Studies with lower intensity intervention supports under real-world
  conditions are lacking. This study examined changes in weight and cardiometabolic
  biomarkers among Spirited Life participants following initial 12-month weight loss
  at 12–24 months and 24–42 months. A total of 719 clergy received a wellness intervention,
  including a 10-week online weight-loss program in the first 12 months and monthly
  health coaching throughout 24 months. Mean changes in weight, blood pressure, high-density
  lipoproteins, and triglycerides were estimated using random effects linear models,
  accounting for repeated measures. Weight was additionally analyzed in subsamples
  stratified by body mass index (BMI). At baseline, 17.1% of participants had BMI
  &lt; 25 kg/m2 and 11.8% had BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2. Mean 12-month weight loss was −2.4 kg
  (95% CI: −2.8 kg, −2.1 kg). On average, at 42 months, participants regained weight
  but did not exceed baseline (−0.5 kg, 95% CI: −1.2 kg, 0.2 kg), improvements in
  triglycerides were completely sustained (−13.9 mg/dL, 95% CI: −18.6 mg/dL, −9.2
  mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure improvements remained significant (−1.9 mmHg,
  95% CI: −3.0 mmHg, −0.9 mmHg). Participants with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 lost significantly
  more weight that was sustained at 42 months (−5.8 kg, 95% CI: −8.9 kg, −2.7 kg).
  The Spirited Life wellness intervention produced weight loss and, for participants
  with higher levels of obesity, sustained weight-loss maintenance. The intervention
  was effective for long-term prevention of weight gain among participants with BMI
  of 25 to ≤40 kg/m2, through 42 months. Wellness interventions such as Spirited Life
  should be considered for adoption.'
