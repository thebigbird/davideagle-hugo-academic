abstract: This study extends social-psychological research on social networks and
  mental health by examining cross-gender differences in social integration and depression
  among United Methodist clergy in North Carolina. Using data from the fifth wave
  of the Clergy Health Initiative panel survey, we used cross-group models to examine
  the association of depressive symptoms and network in-degree, out-degree, and perceived
  social isolation among men (N = 1,145) and women (N = 535) clergy. The analysis
  reveals gendered differences in this association. Specifically, out-degree bore
  a significant negative relationship with depressive symptoms for men but not women.
  Feeling socially isolated had a significant positive association with depression
  in both men and women.
