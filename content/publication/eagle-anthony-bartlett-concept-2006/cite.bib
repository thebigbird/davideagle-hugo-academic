 abstract = {Many theologians have recently argued that atonement theories related to the
Anselmian tradition introduce violent conflict into the very nature of God, which
effectively destroys God’s unity—a unity that is self-giving love. Mennonite
theology, with its emphasis on a theology of peace, shares similar concerns. J.
Denny Weaver takes issue with the dominance of the Anselmian satisfaction
theory, particularly because of its inherent violence.1 In The Nonviolent
Atonement, he articulates a view that “charts a path of nonviolent atonement
through territory strewn with images and assumptions of violence.”2 He argues
for narrative Christus Victor as a superior and inherently nonviolent atonement
motif. However, I challenge Weaver’s claim. I contend that Mennonite
theologians would find better resources for articulating a nonviolent approach
in the work of Anthony Bartlett in his recent book, Cross Purposes: The Violent
Grammar of Christian Atonement. Below I will raise questions about Weaver’s
work and attempt to explain how Bartlett’s paradigm offers a better approach.},
