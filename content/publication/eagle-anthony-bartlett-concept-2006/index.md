abstract: 'Many theologians have recently argued that atonement theories related to
  the Anselmian tradition introduce violent conflict into the very nature of God,
  which effectively destroys God’s unity—a unity that is self-giving love. Mennonite
  theology, with its emphasis on a theology of peace, shares similar concerns. J.
  Denny Weaver takes issue with the dominance of the Anselmian satisfaction theory,
  particularly because of its inherent violence.1 In The Nonviolent Atonement, he
  articulates a view that “charts a path of nonviolent atonement through territory
  strewn with images and assumptions of violence.”2 He argues for narrative Christus
  Victor as a superior and inherently nonviolent atonement motif. However, I challenge
  Weaver’s claim. I contend that Mennonite theologians would find better resources
  for articulating a nonviolent approach in the work of Anthony Bartlett in his recent
  book, Cross Purposes: The Violent Grammar of Christian Atonement. Below I will raise
  questions about Weaver’s work and attempt to explain how Bartlett’s paradigm offers
  a better approach.'
