abstract: The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a widely used, reliable, and ecologically
  valid method for inducing acute stress under controlled conditions. Traditionally,
  the TSST is administered with staff physically present with participants, which
  limits the participant populations that can be exposed to the TSST. We describe
  an adaptation of the TSST to remote, online delivery over video-conferencing, which
  we call the internet-delivered Trier Social Stress Test (iTSST). This adaption has
  participants use wearable, self-administered ECG monitors received and returned
  via mail. Fifty participants were recruited to take part in a pilot study evaluating
  stress-reduction interventions and completed the iTSST at two occasions separated
  by approximately 12 weeks. Perceived stress and heart rate variability (HRV) were
  measured during both administrations of the iTSST. Forty-one participants completed
  both assessments and were included in the set of analyses. Both administrations
  were characterized by an increase in self-reported stress and reduction in self-reported
  relaxation from the resting phase to the speech task, which returned to baseline
  during recovery. In terms of HRV, we observed a significant parasympathetic response
  to the iTSST in 90% of participants, evidenced by a decrease in RMSSD and increase
  in heart rate from resting to the speech task, which recovered during the recovery
  phase. In terms of repeatability, there was little evidence of habituation and the
  iTSST elicited a stress response during both the initial administration and the
  12-week follow-up. While the utility is limited by the lack of a measure of sympathetic
  and HPA-axis activity, the iTSST represents a promising research tool when physically
  interacting with participants is not feasible.
