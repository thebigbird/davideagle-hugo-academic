abstract: Methods We compared the health of 1414 White and 93 Black clergy. Then,
  we used propensity scores to match Black and White participants on key socioeconomic,
  demographic, occupational, and physical activity characteristics and re-examined
  differences in health. Results Prior to propensity score matching, Black clergy
  reported worse physical health than their White counterparts. They had greater body
  mass index, higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and lower physical health
  functioning. White clergy reported less favorable mental health. They had higher
  severity of depression and anxiety symptoms as well as lower quality of life and
  mental health functioning. Propensity score analysis revealed that matching on SES
  and other key variables accounted for most, but not all, of the observed racial
  differences. Racial disparities in hypertension, depression severity, and mental
  health functioning persisted despite adjustments. Conclusions Race contributed to
  health disparities in some outcomes in our study population, above and beyond our
  measures of participantsâ€™ present SES and key demographic, occupational, and physical
  activity variables. This study provides evidence supporting the position that race
  contributes to health disparities through pathways other than SES.
