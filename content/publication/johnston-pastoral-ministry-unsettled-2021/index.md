abstract: 'Background: COVID-19 and its associated restrictions around in-person gatherings
  have created unprecedented challenges for religious congregations and those who
  lead them. While several surveys have attempted to describe how pastors and congregations
  responded to COVID-19, these provide a relatively thin picture of how COVID-19 is
  impacting religious life. There is scant qualitative data describing the lived reality
  of religious leaders and communities during the pandemic.  Purpose and methods:
  This paper provides a more detailed look at how pastors and congregations experienced
  and responded to COVID-19 and its associated restrictions in the early period of
  the pandemic. To do so, we draw from 26 in-depth interviews with church-appointed
  United Methodist pastors conducted between June and August 2020. Pastors were asked
  to describe how their ministry changed as a result of COVID-19 and interviews were
  analyzed using applied thematic analysis approaches to identify the most common
  emergent themes.  Results: Pastors reported that COVID-19 fundamentally unsettled
  routine ways of doing ministry. This disruption generated both challenges and opportunities
  for clergy and their congregations. In the findings, we describe how clergy responded
  in key areas of ministry-worship and pastoral care-and analyze how the pandemic
  is (re)shaping the way that clergy understood their role as pastors and envisioned
  the future of the Church. We argue for the value of examining the pandemic as an
  \"unsettled\" cultural period (Swidler 1986) in which religious leaders found creative
  ways to (re)do ministry in the context of social distancing. Rather than starting
  from scratch, we found that pastors drew from and modified existing symbolic and
  practical tools to fit pandemic-related constraints on religious life. Notably,
  however, we found that \"redoing\" ministry was easier and more effective in some
  areas (worship) than others (pastoral care).  Conclusions and implications: The
  impact of COVID-19 on pastors and congregations is complex and not fully captured
  by survey research. This study provides a baseline for investigating similarities
  and differences in the responses of pastors within and across denominations and
  traditions. It also provides a baseline for assessing whether changes in ministry
  implemented during the early stages of the pandemic remain in place in the post-COVID
  world.'
