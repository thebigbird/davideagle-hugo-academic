abstract: 'Introduction There are many orphaned and separated children (OSC) in the
  world and caregivers play a crucial role in raising them. Frameworks on employee
  mental health incorporate elements of both enjoyment/difficulties and values (i.e.,
  hedonic and eudaimonic elements), yet existing studies focus on caregivers’ mental
  illness and overlook their specific work activities. Methods We collected diary
  activity log, survey, and interview data from caregivers from five geographic locations:
  Hyderabad, India; Nagaland, India; Ethiopia; Kenya; and Cambodia. We coded and calculated
  the amount of time spent on five frequent activities: cleaning, cooking, caring
  for children, supervising children, and informal educational activities. We calculated
  the mean scores of perceived importance, meaningfulness, enjoyment, and unpleasantness
  for each of the five activities by geographic location. Results A total of 82 participants
  completed surveys and activity logs, and 69 of them participated in interviews.
  Mean time spent per day for the five activities combined ranged from 4.4 h (Nagaland)
  to 9.0 h (Ethiopia). Cooking and cleaning constituted a large portion of caregivers’
  days, ranging from 0.8 h per caregiver per day in Nagaland to 4.7 h in Cambodia,
  and informal educational activities (such as advising, teaching children their letters,
  and teaching from religious texts) constituted the least time, ranging from 0.1 h
  per caregiver per day in Hyderabad to 1.1 h in Nagaland. Participants rated all
  activities high in importance, with cleaning being relatively lower. Overall, enjoyment
  scores were lower than importance and meaningfulness scores. Informal educational
  activities had the highest enjoyment scores in three locations, whereas supervising
  children did in two locations. Participants rated cleaning as the most unpleasant
  activity in each geographic region except Cambodia, where it was rated on par with
  educational activities. Discussion OSC caregivers consider several regular activities
  to be very important and meaningful. Enjoyment may be improved through additional
  support in child behavior management or spending more time providing informal educational
  activities; at minimum, caregiver mental health should be considered before turning
  informal educational activities over to volunteers.'
