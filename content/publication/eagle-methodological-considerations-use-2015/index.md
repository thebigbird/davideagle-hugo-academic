abstract: With data from the Clergy Health Initiative Longitudinal Survey, we look
  for interviewer effects, differences between web and telephone delivery, and panel
  conditioning bias in an “important matters” name generator and interpreter, replicated
  from the U.S. General Social Survey. We ﬁnd evidence of phone interviewers systematically
  inﬂuencing the number of conﬁdants named, we observe that respondents assigned to
  the web survey reported a larger number of conﬁdants, and we uncover strong support
  for panel conditioning. We discuss the possible mechanisms behind these observations
  and conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our ﬁndings for similar
  studies.
