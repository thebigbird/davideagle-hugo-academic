abstract: "In the past, research on social stratification focused primarily on the\
  \ independent contributions of race, socioeconomic status (SES), and gender to status\
  \ attainment. However, contemporary research in the field recognizes that race,\
  \ SES, and gender interact to create complicated systems of inequality that go beyond\
  \ conventional models of stratification. Increasingly, studies add categories such\
  \ as religion and nativity to the mix and uncover even more complex patterns of\
  \ inequality, ones that rarely fit conventional explanations for stratification\
  \ outcomes, particularly for women (Fitzgerald and Glass 2008, 2012; Glass and Jacobs\
  \ 2005; Lehrer 1999a; Sherkat and Darnell 1999). Consider these examples: Education\
  \ is highly correlated with U.S. women's employment and earnings (England, Garcia-Beaulieu,\
  \ and Ross 2004), but is much more so for native-born white and black women than\
  \ for immigrant women (Read and Cohen 2007). Religion is negatively associated with\
  \ women's human capital acquisition among conservative Christians (Lehrer 1999b),\
  \ whereas the opposite is true among U.S. Jews (Gold 2002), and among Arab Americans,\
  \ women evidence a pattern of high educational attainment, but very low labor force\
  \ participation (Read and Oselin 2008). These patterns can create theoretical and\
  \ empirical conundrums for researchers focused on the relationship between any single\
  \ identity (e.g., race, class, gender) and social inequality. In this chapter, we\
  \ examine where the presence of multiple group identities results in status attainment\
  \ outcomes that do not fit neatly within conventional stratification models. We\
  \ use Arab American women as a case study. This group provides a useful case because\
  \ it lies at the intersection of religion and ethnicity, where the cultural dynamics\
  \ shaping women's achievements are especially acute (Read 2004). Arab American women\
  \ also constitute a population that exhibits a paradoxical pattern of high educational\
  \ attainment but low employment (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2000). They provide a\
  \ rich repository of information to examine how multiple identity categories intersect\
  \ to shape outcomes."
