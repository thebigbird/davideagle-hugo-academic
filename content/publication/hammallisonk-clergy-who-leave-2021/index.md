abstract: Since its inception in the 1960s, research on premature (i.e., pre-retirement)
  clergy attrition from congregational ministry has focused on identifying the factors
  that precipitate and mitigate ministry exits, while the rates at which clergy leave
  the ministry have been inconsistently tracked. The literature on clergy attrition
  is peppered with claims of alarmingly high rates of departure; however, these studies
  lack strong empirical support. The evidence, while fragmentary, consistently shows
  that pastors do not leave congregational ministry in large numbers. Incidence of
  attrition of about 1%–2% per year is typical across Protestant denominations and
  among Roman Catholic priests. In addition, contrary to popular conceptions, there
  is little evidence attrition is particularly high in the first 5 years of congregational
  ministry. In terms of the reasons for leaving, among Protestants, the most common
  factor named is conflict with the congregation or denominational system; a smaller
  number leave to pursue personal goals or to care for family. Among Catholics, loneliness
  and isolation, tied in major part to the celibacy requirement, are the most significant
  reasons cited for leaving. Finances or a loss of faith are rarely cited as reasons
  for leaving among either Catholics or Protestants.
