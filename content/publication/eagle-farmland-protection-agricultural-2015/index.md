abstract: Farmland conservation policies typically use zoning and differentiated taxes
  to prevent urban development of farmland, but little is known about the effectiveness
  of these policies. This study adds to current knowledge by examining the impact
  of British Columbia’s Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), established in 1973, which
  severely restricts subdivision and nonagricultural uses for more than 4.7 million
  hectares of farmland. To determine the extent to which the ALR preserves farmland
  by reducing or removing the development option, a multilevel hedonic pricing model
  is used to estimate the impact of land use, geographic, and zoning characteristics
  on farmland value near the capital city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Using sales
  data from 1974 through 2008, the model demonstrates a changing ALR impact over time
  that varies considerably by improved and unimproved land types. In 2008, landowners
  paid 19% less for the typical improved farmland parcel within the ALR versus that
  outside it. This suggests that would-be developers expect permanency in the zoning
  law, and prefer non-ALR zoned land. However, ALR land that is unimproved has a premium
  of 55%, suggesting that this land is more valuable for agriculture than for development.
  Farmland located closer to the city or the commuting highway commands a premium
  if it has a residence on it, with a residence also explaining why smaller agricultural
  properties sell at higher prices. However, it appears that zoning by itself is insufﬁcient
  to protect farmland; other policies likely need to be implemented in conjunction
  with zoning to protect agricultural land.
