abstract: Congregations and other religious organizations are an important part of
  the social welfare system in the United States. This article uses data from the
  2012 National Congregations Study to describe key features of congregational involvement
  in social service programs and projects. Most congregations (83%), containing 92%
  of religious service attendees, engage in some social or human service activities
  intended to help people outside of their congregation. These programs are primarily
  oriented to food, health, clothing, and housing provision, with less involvement
  in some of the more intense and long-term interventions such as drug abuse recovery,
  prison programs, or immigrant services. The median congregation involved in social
  services spent $1500 per year directly on these programs, and 17% had a staff member
  who worked on them at least a quarter of the time. Fewer than 2% of congregations
  received any government ﬁnancial support of their social service programs and projects
  within the past year; only 5% had applied for such funding. The typical, and probably
  most important, way in which congregations pursue social service activity is by
  providing small groups of volunteers to engage in well-deﬁned and bounded tasks
  on a periodic basis, most often in collaboration with other congregations and community
  organizations.
