abstract: Are people less likely to attend large churches? Using nationally representative
  data, I find a negative relationship between size and the probability of attendance
  for Conservative, Mainline, and black Protestants and for Catholics in parishes
  larger than 500 attenders. The addition of control variables does not change these
  patterns. These results support the theory that group cohesion lies at the heart
  of the size-participation relationship in churches. With the rapid growth of megachurches
  in the United States, a negative relationship between size and frequency of attendance
  could serve to accelerate aggregate declines in attendance. Methodologically, this
  article demonstrates how Bayesian hierarchical models can handle complex data structures
  and imputation procedures in a unified model.
