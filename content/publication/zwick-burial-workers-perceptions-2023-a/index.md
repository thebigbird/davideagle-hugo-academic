abstract: Community Health Workers (CHWs) provide vital services during disease outbreaks.
  Appropriate burials of those who died from an infectious disease outbreak is a critical
  CHW function to prevent infection and disease spread. During the 2018 Ebola Virus
  Disease (EVD) outbreak in Beni Town, North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
  we sought to understand the levels of understanding, trust, and cooperation of the
  community in response to the outbreak, the barriers burial workers faced in their
  health work and its impact on local burial workers and other CHWs.
