abstract: Chaves (2010) argues that much of the work in the sociology of religion
  is susceptible to the religious congruence fallacy—the tendency to assume consistency
  between religious beliefs and one's attitudes and behaviors across situations when
  they are in fact highly variable. We build on and extend this argument by focusing
  on intersecting group identities as a mechanism for identifying such incongruence,
  not only within religious contexts, but also at the intersection of categories such
  as gender and race. To illustrate this argument, the analysis draws on data from
  the 2006 Panel Study of American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) to assess how race,
  gender, and religion interact to produce different levels of attitude and behavior
  incongruencies on key issues of the day, specifically conservative social values
  and voting behaviors. The results find marked differences and inconsistent relationships
  between attitudes and behaviors across racial-gender groups. We use the analysis
  to highlight the conditions that result in incongruence at the intersections of
  identity categories and pinpoint where social scientists are most vulnerable to
  committing the congruence fallacy.
