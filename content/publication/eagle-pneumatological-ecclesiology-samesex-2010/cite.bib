 abstract = {The debate surrounding the morality of homosexual marriage is one of the
most charged and fractious in the church today. As local congregations,
national denominations, and international affiliations of Christians wrestle
with this issue, significant conflict and division has arisen and continues to
rage. At the center of this debate are so-called ‚Äúarguments from creation,‚Äù that
is, arguments that look to the natural or revealed ‚Äúorder of things‚Äù to discern
God‚Äôs design for appropriate sexual behavior. This mode of theological
argumentation has a long history in the tradition of natural theology, which
assumes that divine direction (and even divine speech) is inherent in
creaturely capacities. In this article, I will demonstrate that New Testament
scholarship is agreed that in Romans 1:18-32 (the key NT text on the issue),
Paul is not making an argument per se against homosexuality. Instead, this
passage fits within the larger claim that he is trying to make throughout the
book of Romans about Jew-Gentile relations. What Paul condemns here is
the human propensity to judge others based on supposedly intrinsic qualities.
He is using a stereotypical Jewish understanding of Gentiles, and turning it
back against those who would argue for some special innate characteristic
within Jews that makes them special and within Gentiles that makes them
depraved.},
