abstract: The debate surrounding the morality of homosexual marriage is one of the
  most charged and fractious in the church today. As local congregations, national
  denominations, and international affiliations of Christians wrestle with this issue,
  significant conflict and division has arisen and continues to rage. At the center
  of this debate are so-called ‚Äúarguments from creation,‚Äù that is, arguments that
  look to the natural or revealed ‚Äúorder of things‚Äù to discern God‚Äôs design for appropriate
  sexual behavior. This mode of theological argumentation has a long history in the
  tradition of natural theology, which assumes that divine direction (and even divine
  speech) is inherent in creaturely capacities. In this article, I will demonstrate
  that New Testament scholarship is agreed that in Romans 1:18-32 (the key NT text
  on the issue), Paul is not making an argument per se against homosexuality. Instead,
  this passage fits within the larger claim that he is trying to make throughout the
  book of Romans about Jew-Gentile relations. What Paul condemns here is the human
  propensity to judge others based on supposedly intrinsic qualities. He is using
  a stereotypical Jewish understanding of Gentiles, and turning it back against those
  who would argue for some special innate characteristic within Jews that makes them
  special and within Gentiles that makes them depraved.
