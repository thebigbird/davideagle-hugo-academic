abstract: According to the General Social Survey, the combined rate of weekly and
  monthly attendance at religious services in Canada has declined by about 20 points
  from 1986 to 2008. Approximately half of this decline stems from the increase in
  the proportion of people reporting no religion, who, for the most part, do not attend
  religious services. The other portion of this decline is attributable to eroding
  attendance rates among Catholics, particularly older Catholics, and Protestants
  in Que´bec. Attendance rates for Protestants outside of Que´bec show signs of increase.
  The reported increase in weekly attendance in Canada by the Project Canada surveys
  and cited by Bibby as a possible indicator of a religious renaissance is revealed
  as an artifact in the data due to an oversample of Protestants. I ﬁnd another weighting
  problem in the Canadian Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating that leads
  to underestimates of aggregate religious attendance rates.
