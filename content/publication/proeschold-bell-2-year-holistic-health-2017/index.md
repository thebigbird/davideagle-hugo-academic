abstract: 'Introduction: This study sought to determine the effect of a 2-year, multicomponent
  health intervention (Spirited Life) targeting metabolic syndrome and stress simultaneously.
  Design: An RCT using a three-cohort multiple baseline design was conducted in 2010–2014.
  Setting/participants: Participants were United Methodist clergy in North Carolina,
  U.S., in 2010, invited based on occupational status. Of invited 1,745 clergy, 1,114
  consented, provided baseline data, and were randomly assigned to immediate intervention
  (n¼395), 1-year waitlist (n¼283), or 2-year waitlist (n¼436) cohorts for a 48-month
  trial duration. Intervention: The 2-year intervention consisted of personal goal
  setting and encouragement to engage in monthly health coaching, an online weight
  loss intervention, a small grant, and three workshops delivering stress management
  and theological content supporting healthy behaviors. Participants were not blinded
  to intervention. Main outcome measures: Trial outcomes were metabolic syndrome (primary)
  and self-reported stress and depressive symptoms (secondary). Intervention effects
  were estimated in 2016 in an intention-to-treat framework using generalized estimating
  equations with adjustment for baseline level of the outcome and follow-up time points.
  Log-link Poisson generalized estimating equations with robust SEs was used to estimate
  prevalence ratios (PRs) for binary outcomes; mean differences were used for continuous/score
  outcomes. Results: Baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 50.9% and depression
  was 11.4%. The 12-month intervention effect showed a beneﬁt for metabolic syndrome
  (PR¼0.86, 95% CI¼0.79, 0.94, po0.001). This beneﬁt was sustained at 24 months of
  intervention (PR¼0.88; 95% CI¼0.78, 1.00, p¼0.04). There was no signiﬁcant effect
  on depression or stress scores. Conclusions: The Spirited Life intervention improved
  metabolic syndrome prevalence in a population of U.S. Christian clergy and sustained
  improvements during 24 months of intervention. These ﬁndings offer support for long-duration
  behavior change interventions and population-level interventions that allow participants
  to set their own health goals.'
