abstract: Clergy are tasked with multiple interpersonal administrative, organizational,
  and religious responsibilities, such as preaching, teaching, counseling, administering
  sacraments, developing lay leader skills, and providing leadership and vision for
  the congregation and community. The high expectations and demands placed on them
  put them at an increased risk for mental distress such as depression and anxiety.
  Lit‑tle is known about whether and how clergy, helpers themselves, receive care
  when they experience mental distress. All active United Methodist Church (UMC) clergy
  in North Carolina were recruited to take a survey in 2019 comprising validated depression
  and anxiety screeners and questions about mental health service utili‑zation. Bivariate
  and Poisson regression analyses were conducted on the subset of participants with
  elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms to determine the extent of mental health
  service use during four different timeframes and the relationship between service
  use and sociodemographic variables. A total of 1,489 clergy partici‑pated. Of the
  222 (15%) who had elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms or both, 49.1% had not
  ever or recently (in the past two years) seen a mental health profes‑sional. Participants
  were more likely to report using services currently or recently (in the past two
  years) if they were younger, had depression before age 21, or \"very often\" felt
  loved and cared for by their congregation. The rate of mental health ser‑vice use
  among UMC clergy is comparable to the national average of service use by US adults
  with mental distress. However, it is concerning that 49% of clergy with elevated
  symptoms were not engaged in care. This study points to clergy subgroups to target
  for an increase in mental health service use. Strategies to support clergy and minimize
  mental health stigma are needed.
