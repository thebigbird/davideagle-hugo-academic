abstract: We argue that perceived support is best conceptualized more as a measure
  of how an individual appraises his/her situation rather than a true reflection of
  how much support he/she receives. To test this theory, we used survey data from
  the Clergy Health Initiative Panel Survey to examine the relationship between perceived
  and received social support and their association with depressive symptoms in clergy
  (N Â¼ 1,288). Overall, analyses revealed perceived support had a weak association
  with received support. Greater perceived support had a significant relationship
  with lower depressive symptoms. In contrast, greater received support had only a
  small relationship with lower depressive symptoms, which was fully mediated by perceived
  support. Our results raise questions about the effectiveness of many clergy social
  support interventions, which often aim to boost the quality and/or quantity of received
  social support. We suggest it may be more advantageous to boost perceptions of social
  support, possibly through cognitive reframing or positive mental health interventions.
