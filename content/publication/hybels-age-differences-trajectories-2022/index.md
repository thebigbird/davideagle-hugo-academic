abstract: 'Objectives:Work in occupations with higher levels of occupational stress
  can bring mental health costs. Many older adults worldwide are continuing to work
  past traditional retirement age, raising the question whether older adults experience
  depression, anxiety, or burnout at the same or greater levels as younger workers,
  and whether there are differences by age in these levels over time.Design/setting/participants:Longitudinal
  survey of 1161 currently employed US clergy followed every 6–12 months for up to
  66 months.Measurements:Depression was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire
  (PHQ-8). Anxiety was measured using the anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety
  and Depression Scale (HADS). Burnout symptoms were assessed using the three components
  of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP),
  and sense of personal accomplishment (PA).Results:Older participants had lower scores
  of depression, anxiety, EE, and DP and higher levels of PA over time compared to
  younger adults. Levels of EE decreased for older working adults, while not significantly
  changing over time for those younger. DP symptoms decreased over time among those
  55 years or older but increased among those 25–54 years.Conclusions:Older working
  adults may have higher levels of resilience and be able to balance personal life
  with their occupation as well as may engage in certain behaviors that increase social
  support and, for clergy, spiritual well-being that may decrease stress in a way
  that allows these older adults to appear to tolerate working longer without poorer
  mental health outcomes.'
