abstract: "Background Child well-being is associated with caregiver mental health.\
  \ Research has focused on the absence or presence of mental health problems, such\
  \ as depression, in caregivers. However, positive mental health – defined as the\
  \ presence of positive emotions, psychological functioning, and social functioning\
  \ – likely prevents depression and in caregivers may benefit children more than\
  \ the mere absence of mental health problems. Little attention has been given to\
  \ how caregivers sustain positive mental health, particularly when doing challenging\
  \ work in impoverished settings. Objective The study's objective was to determine\
  \ what successful caregivers of orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) in diverse\
  \ countries do to sustain their positive mental health. Methods Using a mixed-methods,\
  \ cross-sectional study design, trained local interviewers recruited a convenience\
  \ sample of OVC caregivers through residential care institutions from five geographic\
  \ regions (Kenya; Ethiopia; Cambodia; Hyderabad, India; and Nagaland, India). Participants\
  \ completed surveys and in-depth interviews about strategies used to sustain their\
  \ mental health over time or improve it during challenging times. Results Sixty-nine\
  \ OVC caregivers from 28 residential care institutions participated. Positive mental\
  \ health survey scores were high. We organized the strategies named into six categories\
  \ ordered from most to least frequently named: Religious Practices; Engaging in\
  \ Caregiving; Social Support; Pleasurable Activities; Emotion Regulation; and Removing\
  \ Oneself from Work. Prayer and reading religious texts arose as common strategies.\
  \ Participants reported promoting positive emotions by focusing on their work's\
  \ meaning and playing with children. The similar findings across diverse regions\
  \ were striking. Some differences included more emphasis on emotion control in Ethiopia;\
  \ listening to music/singing in Kenya and Hyderabad; and involving children in the\
  \ tasks the participants enjoyed less (e.g., cleaning) in Cambodia. Conclusions\
  \ Under real-world conditions, small daily activities appeared to help sustain positive\
  \ mental health. In addition, fostering structures that allow caregivers to engage\
  \ regularly in rewarding caregiving tasks may be an affordable and scalable idea\
  \ which could potentially benefit caregivers, children, and employers."
