abstract: 'Studies of caregivers of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) rarely examine
  the role religion plays in their lives. We conducted qualitative interviews of 69
  caregivers in four countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Cambodia, and India (Hyderabad and
  Nagaland), and across four religious traditions: Christian (Orthodox, Roman Catholic,
  and Protestant), Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu. We asked respondents to describe the
  importance of religion for their becoming a caregiver, the way in which religion
  has helped them make sense of why children are orphans, and how religion helps them
  face the challenges of their occupation. Using qualitative descriptive analysis,
  three major themes emerged. Respondents discussed how religion provided a strong
  motivation for their work, reported that religious institutions were often the way
  in which they were introduced to caregiving as an occupation, and spoke of the ways
  religious practices sustain them in their work. They rarely advanced religion as
  an explanation for why OVC existâ€”only when pressed did they offer explicitly religious
  accounts. This study has implications for OVC care, including the importance of
  engaging religious institutions to support caregivers, the significance of attending
  to local religious context, and the vital need for research outside of Christian
  contexts.'
