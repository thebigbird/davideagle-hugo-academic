abstract: The VIA Classification of Character Strengths has broken important ground
  for measuring character strengths across cultures. Because the VIA Classification
  is a closed system of abstract strengths, however, it is unknown how end-users engage
  strengths in particular cultural and practical contexts, define strengths for themselves,
  or identify additional strengths. In this study, residential care directors (n =
  18) and other caregivers (n = 64) for orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) in
  five distinct global locations prioritized with a card-sort the VIA Character Strengths
  most important for the work of caregiving, defined these strengths, and proposed
  additional strengths. Supervisors were then asked how caregivers embodied their
  prioritized strengths. Participants most frequently prioritized Love, Honesty, Forgiveness,
  and Kindness as important for caregiving; demonstrated high concordance but also
  some deviation from the definitions of the VIA Classification; and proposed additional
  strengths (e.g. Caring, Self-drive, and Initiative) that were perceived not to overlap
  with existing VIA Character Strengths.
